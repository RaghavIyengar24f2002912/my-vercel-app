<p>Hi Guddu ,</p>
<p>I didnâ€™t make any changes to file and it worked for me. Can you mention what is need of making changes ?</p>
<p>command that I used :<br/>
<code>uv run datagen.py 22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --root ./data</code></p>
<p>here --root option defines the folder where you want to store generated data.
