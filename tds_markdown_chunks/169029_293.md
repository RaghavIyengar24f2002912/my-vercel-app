In one of the sessions, you had mentioned the possibility of offering alternate questions as a second chance for students, evaluated at half the original marking scheme (i.e., 2 marks per question).</p><hr>

<h4>23f2000237 (#479)</h4>
<p>I checked my Vercel logs and saw that the requests were sent to the /api endpoint instead of the /api/ endpoint that I specifically gave in the google forms.</p>
<p>To confirm this I also sent a request to /api and /api/ enpoints and the /api gave a 404 error while /api/ gave a 200 message.</p>
<p>Please look into this<br/>

Hello sir,<br/>
I apologize for bothering you again.<br/>
About 30 minutes ago, I received an email stating that project 2 has been evaluated.
