<p>Hi Telvin,</p>
<p>Try opening <code>localhost:8080</code> in browser if that works, if it opens in browser then issue might be with some network configurations.</p>
<p>I solved this question in github codespace, which didnâ€™t require me to make any changes in network.</p>
<p>kind regards</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/nelson">@Nelson</a> I would recommend <a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a> or <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/">Docker CE</a> rather than <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">Docker Desktop</a>.</p>
<p>Docker Desktop is <a href="https://docs.docker.com/subscription/desktop-license/">not free for organizations over 250 people</a> and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.</p><hr>
