<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/thinkmachine">@thinkmachine</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/22f3002723">@22f3002723</a></p>
<p>Since you updated docker repo few days ago and docker api doensâ€™t support timestamp based pulling we will pull your GitHub repo before 18 th feb and will build through it and run evaluations.</p>
<p>We also have your docker repo evaluation score, will discuss which one to keep.</p>
<p>This is for anyone who updated their docker repo and there are around 10-20 such cases</p><hr>
