<p><strong>GA Platform Changes:</strong> Initially, we were solving questions on <a href="https://exam.sanand.workers.dev">exam.sanand.workers.dev</a> . However, in GA6, we moved to <em>Seek</em> and in GA7, to <em>Google Forms</em>. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.</p>

<p>The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server.
