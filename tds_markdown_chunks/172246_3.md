Due to other academic commitments, such as Project 2, some of us were unable to complete GA7.</p>
<p>Now, we have come to know that some of our peers have received an email stating that they have been awarded +5 bonus marks, which directly contribute to the final score. In some cases, this may even impact the final grade. Since this information was not communicated earlier, we kindly request you to consider providing an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn these bonus marksâ€”perhaps through reviewing submissions or another form of assessment.</p>
<p>We sincerely request your understanding on this matter and would be grateful if you could provide an opportunity for us to earn the bonus marks as well.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your kind consideration.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br/>
