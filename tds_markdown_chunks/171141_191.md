<em>design</em> a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else)</li>
<li>Execute those workflows (<em>walk</em> the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed.</li>
<li>Observe the final result, and repeat if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, a similar framework was suggested in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this ICLR 2022 paper</a>. That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction.</p>
<p>To make environment interaction possible, the agent didn’t need dozens of narrow tools — just a small, well-defined set of <strong>general-purpose tools</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A REPL executor (for quick calcs)</li>
<li>A Python script runner</li>
<li>A Shell executor</li>
</ul>
<p>With just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally — avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors.
