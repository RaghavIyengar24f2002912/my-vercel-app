<p>Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.</p>

<p>We truly appreciate the efforts being put by the TDS team, but not to be rude here -</p>

<p>Why is Project 1 deadline is on Saturday and not on Sunday, as many of us are doing the course <strong>not as a full-time</strong> student.
