<p>I had built the project well on my Mac OS machine. I am very disappointed with the scores. How do i make amends for revaluation as I feel the code ran well for all tasks on my machine. Please give written steps for revaluation.</p><hr>

<p>Few Students including me have not received any mails regarding TDS Project 1. We don’t even know what went wrong or why we didn’t received. Initially I thought that it can be due to some sending error and i will receive little late but even after 14hrs we have not received anything from the team. How are we supposed to check log and see our mistakes when we didn’t even received marks and logs.
