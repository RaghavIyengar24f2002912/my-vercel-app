The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform’s allowed response duration.</p>

<li><strong>GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a <strong>502 Bad Gateway</strong> error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point.
