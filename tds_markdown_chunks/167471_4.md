<p>Then when our automated script checked if students repos met the requirements and yours did not we immediately sent out a warning email as a opportunity for students to make the necessary corrections.</p>
<p>Then once you realised your mistake, on <strong>Feb 17th at 9:11 pm IST</strong> i.e <em>yesteday</em>, you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations.</p>
<p>Then you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471”]<br/>

<p>showing that your files are in the correct place.</p>
<p>We do not take into consideration modifications to your repo after the deadline because then we would have to extend that curtesy to all students.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p><hr>

Yes, I corrected my repo at 9:11 PM IST, but I had actually written and submitted my query much earlier at 4 PM.
