It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm.</p>
<p>Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?</p><hr>

<h4>Saransh_Saini (#2)</h4>
<p>The name of the Dockerfile should be “Dockerfile” indeed, more over check other sections of your submission like</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the GitHub repo public?</li>
<li>Does it have an MIT license?</li>
<li>Does it have a DockerFile?</li>
<li>Is the Docker image accessible?</li>
</ul><hr>

<p>Oh ok made the changes in Github. I hope submitting again is not required since the links and names are same.</p><hr>
