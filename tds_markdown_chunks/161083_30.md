<p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a>.<br/>
I answered questions on <a href="https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/</a> but didn’t click on the button “Submit Answers” on seek as my answers for 2 questions were incorrect.<br/>
My question is whether I need to submit on seek to save answers on Exam? (I checked my score and saved it on the exam site.)</p><hr>

<p>The seek portal question is to confirm that the student has seen the GA. It does not actually give you a score. Otherwise students sometimes claim that they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence the two stage verification.
