With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for <strong>working professionals</strong> and students without prior experience.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#p-599766-remote-open-exam-roe-graded-assignments-gas-5" name="p-599766-remote-open-exam-roe-graded-assignments-gas-5"></a> <strong>Remote Open Exam (RoE) &amp; Graded Assignments (GAs)</strong></h3>
<p>While we have put in significant effort—spending <strong>2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)</strong> to secure good scores—we still find ourselves <strong>struggling to meet expectations</strong> for the <strong>projects and RoE</strong>, which are significantly harder than anticipated.</p>
<p>We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern.
