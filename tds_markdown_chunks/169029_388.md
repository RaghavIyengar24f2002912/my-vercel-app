I notice that I am not providing a preloaded answer when this question arises. Instead, it creates a new repository and an HTML file, then deploys it on GitHub. Initially, it presents a URL, but I understand that your server checks to verify whether the URL contains valid HTML. This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment.</p>
<p>At that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct.
