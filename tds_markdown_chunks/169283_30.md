Specifically, forecast the 2027 resale value of the Kawasaki - Ninja 300 in Tamil Nadu, using historical data.</p>
<p>134483</p>
<p>94774</p>
<p>150666</p>
<p>199711</p>
<p>Whose correct option (through different methods and algorithms) was approximately closest to 94774 and again answer pushed is 150666 which again turns out to be incorrect</p>
<p>So is the case with questions 1 and 2 (where answers arenâ€™t pushed according to absolute values, but as conveyed earlier, I believe this shall be resolved)</p>
<p>Kindly look into it</p>
<p>Thanks and Regards</p><hr>
