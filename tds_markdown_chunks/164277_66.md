It won’t happen in the future anyway.</p>
<p><strong>What’s happening?</strong> I was trying to generate a unique hash for each request, as a precursor to caching requests. But I made a mistake in the code. Specifically, <code>crypto.createHash</code> is not supported in CloudFlare. <a href="https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy/commit/5943b6d355deffff88ac07d17aa0c6969cacc3d5">I fixed that</a> by removing this. I’ll introduce caching later if required.</p><hr>
