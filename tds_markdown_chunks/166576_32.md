A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.‚Äù</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Since the simple approach did not work, I attempted a more complex query to achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog.<br/>
I would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue.
