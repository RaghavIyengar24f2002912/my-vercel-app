<p>Once i close my local llm and close the nrgrok URL (after entering the answer and the answer being correct), the next time I refresh or check the answer in the Ga2 site, q10 gets marked wrong. I have to redo the entire process for it to be correct again.</p>
<p>Can you clarify why this is happening?</p><hr>

<p>Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat.</p>
<p>That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE.
