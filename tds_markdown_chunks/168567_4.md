Thanks for the opportunity to share my thought process. 
What does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning. 

Implicit learning is “How much can they answer if woken up from sleep?”
Explicit learning is “How much can they answer given time and Internet?”

Some may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They’ll answer those in a few seconds. 
Some, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That’s explicit learning.
