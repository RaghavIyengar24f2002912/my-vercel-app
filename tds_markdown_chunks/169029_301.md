<p>Basically should we resubmit the link using the form sent today if our link has not changed?</p>
<p>PS: Maybe send a mail to everyone to update the access of their GA7 links to viewer for everyone at IIT Madras.</p><hr>

sir,<br/>
I kept my laptop on overnight, but in the morning I see my vs-code application and ngrok server along with google chrome was closed on itâ€™s own. I am confused, do I have to run again ?
