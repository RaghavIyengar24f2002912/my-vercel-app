<p>hi,</p>
<p>I dont share your views.</p>
<p>i feel it was one of the best course in whole of Diploma.</p>
<p>I have learned a lot in these projects and even in ROE preparation.</p>
<p>all the things we are learning here are open in market and the course contents are great direction towards learning and practicing them.</p>
<p>I agree it is stessful, my whole team were in a 9-hour g-meet call on Saturday night. but we have found solutions, shared ideas, try-outs, made fun of each other.</p>
<p>but at the end of the day we all agree that we have learnt lots of new things.</p>
<p>Regarding Project1 delay: if we think, atleast 1GB of docker image per students for 700+ students.
