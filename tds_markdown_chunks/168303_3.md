So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more.</p>
<p>We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs.</p>
<p>Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system.</p>
<p>Hope that give you some insight into how TDS works.</p>
<p>Thanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP.<br/>
Kind regards</p><hr>
