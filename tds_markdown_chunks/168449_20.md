<p>We will have it uploaded sometime this morning.</p>
<p>It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The chaos of ROE.</li>
<li>The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.</li>
<li>The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).</li>
<li>The value of efficient and effective collaboration.
