I would appreciate your guidance on these issues.</p><hr>

<p>https will be part of the link (provided ‘link’ is one of the checkpoints of evaluation)</p><hr>

<h4>23f1000422 (#146)</h4>
<p>is it resolved?<br/>
i too am getting the same error,even if it was working fine yesterday.</p><hr>

<h4>23f2004907 (#145)</h4>
<p>Try to copy the error data<br/>
The problem might be off dot<br/>
check one dot is on right of m and other right of 0 in keyboard<br/>
these two dots may represent different meanings</p><hr>

<h4>23f2004907 (#144)</h4>
<p>Your dot of 2.9 may be the dot from alphabet or numeric one<br/>
Try to copy the value and then replace it</p><hr>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> Sir, can I suggest to replace the snapshot of example output which expects the year to be an integer and the ratings as to be floats (instead of actual evaluation which expects them to be strings).
