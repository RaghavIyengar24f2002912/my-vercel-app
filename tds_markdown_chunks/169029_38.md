Some of the questions include pictures and we cannot use LLM for pictures.</p><hr>

<p>Since the token is limited, I have thought to use the run llms locally,  to check for the accuracy of solving the question.</p>
<ol>
<li>I want to know which LLM will be more closer to the one used for evaluating our project.</li>
<li>Does the model used for evaluation is capable for handling raw files, or we need to pass it in the text format..(As as I am to recall, the models are capable enough to handle the files..)<br/>
Thanks!</li>
</ol>
<p>Does anyone willing to work with me..?<br/>

<p>My Approach , is to</p>
<ol>
<li>scrape and parse all the current question</li>
<li>create embeddings ,  of the questions.</li>
<li>create a test endpoint , just to check if i am able to correctly identify the questions</li>
<li>segregate numerical , string and json responses and see if these can be answered part of phase 1</li>
<li>Phase 2 , experiment with url based answers.
