A look at prior end terms is a good indicator of how easy they are.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@Carlton</a> With just 5 days left, I wanted to ask for a quick suggestion.</p>
<p>I’m prioritizing PYQs for sure, but between revisiting lectures and attending TA sessions (both quite time-consuming), which one would you recommend focusing on for better returns?</p>
<p>Also, if possible, could you please point out the top 2–3 most important topics—maybe things like LLM, Data Sourcing, etc.—to give more attention to?</p><hr>

<p>I recommend attending the Tues and Thurs session this week or watching the recordings. Its the same every term, those that attend the session score the best marks. I say this because there is no way for me to convey in a discourse post all the important things to focus on.
