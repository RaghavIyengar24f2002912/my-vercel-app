However, during the subsequent evaluation, the image was rebuilt using my GitHub repo link, and unfortunately, the <code>app.py</code> file could not be found. As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle.</p>
<p>I would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the <code>app.py</code> file does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder:<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/blob/main/app/app.py" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py</a>.<br/>
But as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only: <a href="https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent</a>.</p>
<p>Humbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances.
