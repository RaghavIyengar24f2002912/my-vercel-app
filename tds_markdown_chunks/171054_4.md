I can’t join the meet since I’m out of station and don’t have PC access. I also have other coursework, so I’ll be available for a meet from the 31st onwards</p><hr>

Just wanted to ask how did you frame your questions for the Graded Assignments? Cause that will help me complete mine.<br/>
Thanks in advance</p><hr>
