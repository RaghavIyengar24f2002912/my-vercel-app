<p>We are sending an email out for all those that have raised an issue within the next few hours. The content of the email will be to keep your server up in the window that we prescribe. That window will be mentioned in the email. You do not need to keep the vm running at the moment. Just check the email when it comes.</p><hr>

<p>there is no automatic appending.<br/>
We will test <strong>exactly</strong> what we sent in the email (if you got an email) which is <strong>exactly</strong> what you submitted .</p><hr>

<p>Could someone clarify whether the endpoint should include /api when being evaluated? I submitted it without /api and Iâ€™m wondering if it will be automatically appended or if we must include it explicitly.
