<p>Release of Project 2 has been delayed by 3 days, and release of Assignment 6 has been delayed by 10 days.</p>
<p>Could you please clarify if the submission dates will be changed accordingly? I am assuming it will have to be changed for Assignment 7 as well.</p>
<p>Please let me know rough submission dates if possible so that I can plan accordingly (my schedule in the upcoming days is very hectic).</p><hr>
