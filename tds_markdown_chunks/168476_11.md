<ul>
<li>Many students pursuing this course are <strong>dual-degree students or working professionals</strong>, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.</li>
<li>The <strong>last-minute guidance</strong> for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.</li>
<li>The <strong>structuring and scheduling of sessions</strong> feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#p-599787-request-for-improvement-3" name="p-599787-request-for-improvement-3"></a><strong>Request for Improvement</strong></h3>
<p>To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2</strong>, well in advance of the deadline.</li>
<li><strong>More structured and accessible support</strong>, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.</li>
<li><strong>Better management of exam difficulty levels</strong>, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made.
