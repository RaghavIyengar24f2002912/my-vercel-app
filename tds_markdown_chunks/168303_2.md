<p>If possible, could you inform what weeks the project 2 would be based on (like Project 1 was based on week 3 content). Thanks in advance.</p><hr>

<h4>carlton (#4)</h4>
<p>Project 1 was based on Module 1 through 3.<br/>
Project 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase.</p>
<p>We generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started.</p>
<p>The GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations.
