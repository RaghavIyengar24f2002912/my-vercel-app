If they break, the agent will never try to ‘fix’ them and keep calling them like a broken record.</p>
<p>At the core of it, it’s all about <strong>how much flexibility vs rigidity</strong> we give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between — The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio.</p>
<p>Since most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to,</p>
<ul>
<li>Reason about the task, understand intent,</li>
<li>Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e.
