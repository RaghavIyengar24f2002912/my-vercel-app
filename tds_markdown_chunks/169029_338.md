Below are the key points that I need you to look into:</p>
<p> <strong>Server is running and reachable.</strong><br/>
 <strong>GET and POST requests tested via Postman and VS Code</strong>, both return <strong>200 OK</strong>.<br/>
 <strong>Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people</strong> – all received correct results.<br/>
 <strong>No issues seen in logs or deployment</strong> – everything was set up properly.<br/>
 <strong>Others in my group got full marks</strong> – we worked on the same project.</p>
<p> <strong>I have no idea what went wrong during the evaluation.</strong><br/>
 <strong>I’ve spent weeks working on this project</strong>, including sleepless nights.<br/>
 <strong>This is my last term</strong> – if I fail, I will have to repeat the entire diploma.</p>
<p>Please recheck my project thoroughly.
