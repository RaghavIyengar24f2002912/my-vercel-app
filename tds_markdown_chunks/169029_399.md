It was a genuine mistake on my part. However, I noticed in a previous thread that another student who submitted using a different email ID was given a chance to update it. I kindly request you to consider giving me the same opportunity as well.<br/>
I have given my endpoint to the gform circulated in this thread.</p><hr>

<p>You submitted google form with wrong email address.<br/>
This was the email address you used for filling form.</p>

<p>Sir, I had submitted the project on 31st March at 11:30 PM itself. However, I made a change to the Vercel endpoint and updated it on 1st April. I can provide a screenshot of the Vercel deployment as proof. Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t keep a copy of the Google Form submission.
