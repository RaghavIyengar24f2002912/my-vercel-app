I also tested my api with questions with different parameters to make sure it is giving correct responses. You are requested to kindly recheck and share the evaluation logs.</p><hr>

<p>Dear TAs please help - even I got 0 in project 2 even though I have submitted the right links with all prerequisites &amp; working server. If you can share some evaluation logs or errors that would be very helpful to know where I went wrong possibly.</p><hr>

<p>Hi Sir,</p>
<p>Even I got zero in project 2. My server was running fine and both get and post requests were going through. I stopped the server after I got a confirmation mail that the evaluation were completed.
