The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - <em>Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help</em><br/>
Again to quote Anand:</li>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>We encourage learning by sharing</strong></p>
<p>You <em>CAN</em> copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).</p>
<p><strong>Why should you copy?</strong> Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.</p>
<p><strong>To learn well, understand</strong> what you’re copying.
