Is it not correct? We would have at least expected the branch passed in the request.</p>
<p>For Task B8, I could not see the task description sent in the request in evaluation log file. Can you please check if the task request was passed properly?<br/>
Because I see only “=4 B8 failed: not all arguments converted during string formatting” for Task B8</p><hr>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a>, I checked my Docker log file now and realised I missed to push a couple of files to the image. Is there anything I could do now?
