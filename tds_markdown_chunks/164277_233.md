Merged your PR pointing to the correct link for <code>evaluate.py</code></p><hr>

<h4>23f3002091 (#520)</h4>
<p>Yes actually Thats my doubt , when I run both in same folder it is working , but only after task a1 runs datagen.py will be downloaded in /data folder  right ?,</p>
<p>or did I misunderstood something??</p><hr>

<h4>Aditya_Sahu (#519)</h4>
<p>The reason for error is <code>evaluate.py</code> is trying to import <code>datagen.py</code> which doesnâ€™t exist in your system.
