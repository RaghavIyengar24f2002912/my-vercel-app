<h1>Live sessions regarding Project 1</h1>
<h4>23f2000237 (#1)</h4>
<p>In the discussion Thread for Project 1, it was said that there will be live sessions conducted for the project, however, there hasnâ€™t been one specifically for it.</p>
<p>If there are live sessions that will be conducted, can we have some hands on tutorial for the project ?</p><hr>

<p>Hi Sakthivel,</p>
<p>We are still covering the precursors for Project. Once we cover the required topics then we will have sessions that work through the project with the students.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p><hr>
