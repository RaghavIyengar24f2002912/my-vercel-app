Put some light on this poor soul’s message also ;')</p><hr>

<h4>carlton (#245)</h4>
<p>I agree with you. It should have been explicitly mentioned in the project page (even if we have mentioned it in live sessions)</p><hr>

<p>Thanks for the quick reply, i don’t have a convincing argument to counter. Just a suggestion it would have been better if you have explicitly put in the sanity check requirements. Something so obvious to you might not be so for others.<br/>
if you are referring to this email even here, it was not explicit. Might have missed it in the gmeet.
