While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research. <em>Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff!</em></p>
<p>I am actually very thankful to the TDS course team &amp; <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with. <strong>Food for thought!
