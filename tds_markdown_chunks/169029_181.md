<p>Just extend the deadline for one day please it will be a great help for many students</p><hr>

<h4>Algsoch (#278)</h4>
<p>I noticed that ngrok disconnects after two hours, so I’m wondering if we can continue using it.</p>
<p>If your team was aware of this, I’d like to understand why it was allowed to deploy on ngrok.
