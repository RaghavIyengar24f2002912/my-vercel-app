Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application.</p>
<p><code>if __name__ == "__main__":</code> is used to execute some code <strong>only</strong> if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application.</p>
<p>Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default <code>handler</code> class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared.</p>
