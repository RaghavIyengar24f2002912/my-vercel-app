I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers.</p>

<p>If you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video.</p>
<p>But feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up.</p>
