<h1>Regarding Github Mail For Project</h1>
<h4>23f1001236 (#1)</h4>
<p>Is it important to use an IITM mail ID in GitHub for the project?<br/>

<h4>carlton (#2)</h4>
<p>Currently we do not have any explicit policy regarding requiring IITM email as the github profile name or the github repo owner.</p>
<p>We DO however require you to use your IITM email when submitting the project submission form.</p>
<p>We are clarifying with operations at the moment if this arrangement satisfies their requirements. If it changes we will make a general announcement via email, portal and discourse.</p>
<p>(we do not expect the current requirements of github to change)</p>
<p>Kind regards</p><hr>
