If there was a bonus on the course grade T which would make a huge difference on the final grade I think it should have been told to us upfront.</p><hr>

<p>Hello sir, I too did not do the GA7 since the best 4 out of 7 would be considered and I had my college examinations during that time.</p>
<p>I was not aware that doing reviews for GA7 would grant bonus marks and I have not received any mails regarding it.</p><hr>

<p>Yes <a class="mention" href="/u/jkmadathil">@jkmadathil</a> sir, I did receive this email from one of my peers, although we are not closely acquainted, making it difficult to complete a review with the peer who shared the email.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the course, it has been emphasized that the <strong>TDS course focuses more on teamwork</strong> and collaborative learning than individual study. I fully believe this concept and worked together with my group.
