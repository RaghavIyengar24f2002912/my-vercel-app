<h4>Saransh_Saini (#117)</h4>
<p>It can be 1-5 random questions from all 58 question. Its not like a random question each from each GA. It’s even possible to get all those 5 questions from one single GA.</p><hr>

<h4>Jivraj (#116)</h4>

You can use the <code>zipfile</code> library to extract and access zip files pretty easily. You can even make it so that you don’t even have to download the sent file either zip/csv/etc, in order to access it. All this will be discussed in Thurday’s [27-03-2025] Live Session.
