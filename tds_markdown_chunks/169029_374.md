This suggests that the current deployment environment may be using a restricted or unreliable DNS resolver, which causes access issues on some networks (e.g., Jio).</p>

<h3><a class="anchor" href="#p-620347-suggested-fix-1" name="p-620347-suggested-fix-1"></a> Suggested Fix:</h3>
<p>To ensure reliable access for all students, could you please consider updating the deployment or testing environment to use a <strong>public DNS</strong> provider?</p>
<p>Recommended options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google DNS</strong>: <code>8.8.8.8</code>, <code>8.8.4.4</code></li>
<li><strong>Cloudflare DNS</strong>: <code>1.1.1.1</code>, <code>1.0.0.1</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This can typically be configured via Docker settings or the environment’s networking configuration.</p>

<p>If the DNS change isn’t possible at the moment, I kindly request that you evaluate my project using the <strong>previously deployed endpoint</strong> instead:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">https://tds-project-2-pnlm.onrender.com/api/
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that this endpoint may take <strong>50 to 60 seconds</strong> to respond, as it’s hosted on a platform with a cold start delay — but it is fully functional and provides the correct outputs.</p>
<p>Both endpoints are currently active and return identical results.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your time and support — I truly appreciate the effort you’re putting into helping us succeed in this course!</p>
<p>Best regards,<br/>

Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I’m sorry to bother you again, but I’m in a desperate situation and have no other option but to reach out through this channel.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my previous message, my score has been marked as “absent,” even though I submitted my project well before the deadline.
