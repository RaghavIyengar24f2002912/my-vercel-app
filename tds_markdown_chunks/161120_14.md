<p>Hi Tushar,</p>
<p>For questions which require submitting a url, when you click on save button all those server’s should be running.</p>
<p>For that image uploading question one solution would be to keep image in a particular directory, and then upload from there every time you make a submission.</p>
<p>Kind regards<br/>

<p>For the questions such as cors, llm i have to locally run the code and submit it.After a while if i have to submit it again the prev url that i have submitted is throwing an error. Maybe becaue it is checking the url again at the time of submission. Fix this issue, the similar issue lies with the image compression problem.
