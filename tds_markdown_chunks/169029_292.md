Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a> , <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a><br/>
Sir When i test it locally , my LLM is working fine , even running the app , it gave result in 2 sec ,<br/>
I dont know what happened in the logs , it was showing some runtime error ,<br/>
As i am using free plan of vercel , so it allow for 10 sec only ,<br/>
I think any heavy file being run , so it just take some more time , more than 10 sec , but inbuild feature of free plan allow to run only 10 sec … and thats why this happened , i guess</p>
<p>does it means , my LLM failed ??<br/>
Can you please try some other question , it will work , or even for heavy question it work ,<br/>
You can check its working from interface too<br/>
Please check once !!</p><hr>

This is a gentle reminder to kindly send the confirmation email indicating for whom the evaluation of Project 2 has been completed.</p>
<p>Additionally, I would like to confirm whether we can shut down our Azure VM after this, or if we should keep it running in case there is an additional evaluation.
