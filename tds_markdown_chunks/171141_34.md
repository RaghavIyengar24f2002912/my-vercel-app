I have built my docker image in mac air m1 but i found that my image was run on a x86_64 architecture (I can see this in the logs shared for x86_server_start.log)</p><hr>

Please correct me if Iâ€™m wrong, but I noticed that for tasks <strong>B7</strong>, <strong>B8</strong>, and <strong>B10</strong>, the evaluation log does not include any <strong><code>POST</code> or <code>GET</code> request traces</strong>, unlike the other tasks which have clearly recorded request flows, generated code, and outputs.
