They thought it was worth the effort <strong>before</strong> there was any chance of a bonus. And now you begrudge them that reward for their own diligence.</p>
<p>Once again reiterating this point - Bonus marks are given for activities to students at the discretion of the course team. It always has been. And it has never been widely available to all students in past terms of TDS either. This term is no exception. They are never decided beforehand. They are created as and when there seems to be an appropriate opportunity to reward students for their effort.</p>
<p>The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. But it’s not guaranteed for them either. They have to put in a significant coordinated effort with their peers to actually achieve that. In other words, it’s not a freebie.</p>
<p>I had promised to provide the distribution of people who did GA7 both in terms of number of assignments done and average score in GAA.
