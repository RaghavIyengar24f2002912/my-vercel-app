You still need to  the submissions to get a score for the GA.</p>
<p>The actual GA questions are on <a href="https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/</a> via the seek portal or<br/>
on the <a class="inline-onebox" href="https://tds.s-anand.net/#/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Tools in Data Science</a> introduction page.</p>
