The same thing happened to me.<br/>
I have not received request from Indian ip as far as I can see on the logs.<br/>
Can you please check if my server responded or not ?<br/>
I am using Google cloud and the VM was running continuously…</p><hr>

<p>It seems like your server went offline for some reason when we ran evaluations on it. Keep your server running for the next 2 hours, we’ll run a re-evaluation.</p><hr>
