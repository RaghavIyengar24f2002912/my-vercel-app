<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/24f2006531">@24f2006531</a></p>
<p>You can deploy it anywhere, just test how it works on Heroku, if it works(send request to api endpoint to your application and it should respond with answer)</p>
<p>Kind regards</p><hr>

<p>will the asked question be same which was asked in my GAs (i mean there were variations in problem statements for diff-diff students.)<br/>

<h4>Yogesh1 (#15)</h4>
<p>Was the variation because of the datasets? Or even the problem statement?</p><hr>

<h4>22f3001315 (#16)</h4>
<p>Mostly problem statement like different cities etc</p><hr>

<h4>Yogesh1 (#17)</h4>
<p>Then it comes down to what the project demands, as in what kind of questions the llm will be tested on (like you said).
