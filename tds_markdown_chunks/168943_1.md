<p>Q 7 LLM Embeddings (1 mark)</p>
<p><strong>SecurePay</strong>, a leading fintech startup, has implemented an innovative feature to detect and prevent fraudulent activities in real time. As part of its security suite, the system analyzes personalized transaction messages by converting them into embeddings. These embeddings are compared against known patterns of legitimate and fraudulent messages to flag unusual activity.</p>
<p>Imagine you are working on the SecurePay team as a junior developer tasked with integrating the text embeddings feature into the fraud detection module.
