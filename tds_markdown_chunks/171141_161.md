Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise.</p>
<p>In our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a></p>
<p>So unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.</p>
