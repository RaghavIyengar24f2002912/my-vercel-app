How to handle this question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <strong>GA4 Q10</strong>, very few students were able to solve the question using LLMs or Python during the assignment. Most of us ended up solving it manually. At that time, <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> sir had mentioned that the question would be revised.<br/>
Here is the <a href="https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga4-data-sourcing-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/165959/106">thread link</a> for reference.<br/>
How should we handle this question now?</p>

<p>I have a doubt like when I pass answers in string and in the questions about markdown will the \n characters be properly parsed before checking the correctness of the markdown or will it be directly checked for valid markdown?
