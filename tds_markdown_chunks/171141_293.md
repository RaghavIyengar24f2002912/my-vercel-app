<p>Same here sir, i only changed LICENSE to MIT LICENSE due to the mail i received.<br/>
The LICENSE file was already present in the repo as i submitted my project. The change too was made on the 16th of Feb.<br/>
Sir, I would highly appreciate if you consider it as the rest of the pre-requisites are working well.Due to this, the project is also not being evaulated.<br/>
Thankyou<br/>
