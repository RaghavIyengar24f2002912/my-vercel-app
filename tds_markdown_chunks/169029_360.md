This is after the course TA’s said that I had scored well on the project without revealing my score. But I am pretty sure they won’t classify 0/100 as a good score.</p><hr>

<p>sir, my project 2 score is also showing as 0. Please recheck. As many of us are facing the same issue i kindly request to confirm please. Failing in this subject due this will affect us badly.</p><hr>

<p>Sir, Same here, you can access it via this link <a href="https://phoenix-1743854088883.staticrun.app/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Assignment solver </a></p>
<p>I kindly request you to check immediately by this link as I also have made it as an web app for your ease.</p>
<p>(my friends: please don’t use the link, as the api token request will be over)</p>
<p>Please look after it, already I was marked as absent for project -1 and now for this project -2 as 0.
