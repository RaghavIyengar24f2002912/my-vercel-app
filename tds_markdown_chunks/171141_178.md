<p>Ouch, ok sir… hopefully project 2 doesnt disappoint </p><hr>

<p>In your Dockerfile you didn’t copy taskA.py to the container.</p><hr>

<h4>Jivraj (#275)</h4>
<p>but in Dockerfile in your github repo you didn’t run main.py,</p><hr>

<h4>23f2000599 (#274)</h4>
<p>Ok… I do have a doubt tho, i actually have app.py and main.py in my github, my main.py is running on 8000 and app.py on 5000 …</p><hr>

<h4>Jivraj (#273)</h4>
<p>No. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix.
