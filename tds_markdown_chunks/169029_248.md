If not, is there any way we can show proof of our original submission? Currently, we have email confirmations for both the initial and the edited responses.</p>
<p>We hope this wonâ€™t be a major issue, especially not on the level of Project 1 concerns. Looking forward to a positive resolution from the TDS team.</p>
<p>Thank you<br/>

<p>Dear Sir,<br/>
I would like to clarify the situation regarding my previous submission. Initially, I provided an ngrok link, but due to an error with ngrok, it stopped working. I then found an alternative solution using Cloudflare with a custom domain that I obtained through the GitHub Student Pack. I successfully created a tunnel, and it is currently functional. I can shut down my laptop, and it still works with the same URL when I restart.<br/>
I hope you will consider my case. I submitted my work at that time because I learned about this solution from a fellow student on Discord.
