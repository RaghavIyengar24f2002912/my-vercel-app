It was a good project, and I have obtained the log files. Upon reviewing the log files, I realized that they are unable to read the files. I checked my project on GitHub and discovered that I forgot to uncomment the line that defines the path using the <code>os</code> library. As a result, all file evaluations returned errors such as “can’t read the file.”</p>
<p>I understand that this oversight was my mistake. However, is there any way to reevaluate the code by simply uncommenting that line?
