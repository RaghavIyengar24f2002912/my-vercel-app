But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I donâ€™t know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough.</p>
<p>I scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS.</p>
<p>Now I realize that  I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time.</p>
<p>In MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing <code>SKLearn</code>. Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE.</p>
<p>This course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an <em><strong>implicit</strong></em> way.</p>
<p>This is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2.
