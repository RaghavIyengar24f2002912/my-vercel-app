These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally.</p>
<p>However, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail.<br/>
I acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message.</p>
<p>Action Taken<br/>
To address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission.
