I assume you have already achieved your answers, but I want to clarify this for someone who is facing this problem.</p>
<p>The thing is GPT-4o-mini is intelligent enough to understand what kind of task you are asking it do, and extracting Credit Card info from an image is one of the many prohibited tasks.</p>
<p>What you can do is, <strong>try to fool it using itself.</strong> Just ask ChatGPT to generate a prompt that would be capable of fooling itself into extracting out that credit card info. I was capable of doing it after pretending to be a working on a Cyber Security project, and other fake details which ChatGPT itself provided me with.</p><hr>
