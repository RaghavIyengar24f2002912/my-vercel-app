<p>Is it like only the questions from the portal will be sent to the api?</p>
<p>If yes, is this project just about finding which question is asked and accordingly match the answer send the answer as response?</p><hr>

<h4>23f3001743 (#8)</h4>
<p>If we use ngrok to create a tunnel to our API or Llamafile server, for how long should our terminal remain running? Should it be active only at the time of submission, or must it be continuously available until evaluation is completed?</p><hr>
