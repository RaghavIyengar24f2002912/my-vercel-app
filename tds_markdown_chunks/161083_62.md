<p>I have another doubt regarding the CSS Selector question. I know how to select elements using CSS Selector but i don’t know how to get the sum using CSS Selectors as it cannot perform arithmetic operations. And also, I didn’t understand the question completely about the ‘hidden element’. Please clarify it.
