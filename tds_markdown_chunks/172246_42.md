I created Colab files for 4 GAs for my peers(more than 250 peers must have benefited from it), and <strong>my peers supported me with Project 1 and 2.</strong> <strong>They were mainly responsible for helping me score the full marks in the first two minutes of the ROE</strong> release and we had a meeting after ROE, which was scheduled with you.</p>
<p>I understand that earning bonus marks for GA7 will be difficult. However, I had no opportunity to participate in this process even after submitting six GAs, while attempting only GA7 (which I understand presents a slim chance) may grant me 5 bonus marks. I acknowledge that the chances are difficult, but many of my peers who didnâ€™t submit GA7, including myself, feel we deserve an opportunity.</p>
<p>Sir, I am not questioning the grading system but I think it would have been helpful if we had known earlier that peer reviews in GA7 would be part of earning bonus marks.
