Please keep the question parameter as “question” and file parameter as “file” in the evaluation which is on the Project 2 page and the content type as multipart/form-data.</p>
<p>To clarify if I can handle any one of these 2 methods, I will be fine?</p>
<p>Edit:<br/>
Just now discovered that the field names are indeed “question” and “file” only in both the cases. Sorry for the oversight.</p>
