You need two files:<br/>
evaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts.</li>
<li>Run evalute.py using uv.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task.</p>
<p>Hope that gives clarity.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p><hr>
