Also, kindly pardon me for the long message.</p>
<p>I have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday.</p>
<p>These are the detailed point wise concerns :</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it’s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2½ weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days.
