The recent issue has been disheartening for me, especially because the work I submitted was not a blind copy from someone else.</p>
<p>Had it been otherwise, I wouldn’t have had the courage to reach out. I genuinely care about this course and the learning it offers, and I’m proud of the commitment I’ve shown so far.</p>
<p>With utmost respect, I kindly request you to reconsider evaluating my project again, if there’s any possible way to do so. It would mean a lot to me and would really motivate me to keep pushing forward in this subject.</p><hr>

I also used same docker image which i have given you through form. Its my humble request please consider or give some solution.
