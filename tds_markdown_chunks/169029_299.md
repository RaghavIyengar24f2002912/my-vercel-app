We have just gotten to a stage where if you could just please let us know if our endpoints have been evaluated and there is some score we will happily take it down.<br/>
Kindly bear in mind the there is a financial component ( some of us have free accounts ) involved here and I urge and request you to kindly expedite the evaluation process so that we decrease the financial burden placed upon us by this exerciseâ€¦</p><hr>
