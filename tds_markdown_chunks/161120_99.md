<p>That’s okay, when you click on save answers button just make sure all servers are running.</p><hr>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/24ds1000082_vivek">@24ds1000082_Vivek</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/23f3004114">@23f3004114</a> ,</p>
<p>You guys are not using correct format for response.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">{
  "students": [
    {
      "studentId": 1,
      "class": "1A"
    },
    {
      "studentId": 2,
      "class": "1B"
    }, ...
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is correct for which have a object with key <code>students</code> which is not present in your response.</p>
<p>kind regards</p><hr>

<p>I did that, while running all the severs i saved my answers and it showed “correct”.<br/>
But after sometime when I re-loaded my answers it showed incorrect.</p><hr>

<h4>Jivraj (#141)</h4>
<p>whenever you want to submit your answers by pressing save button at that time only all servers should must be running.</p><hr>
