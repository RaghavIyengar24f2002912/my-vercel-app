<p><em><strong>However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29.</strong></em></p>

<p>But here’s the catch:** Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:*</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementing a ReAct-based workflow planning &amp; orchestration agent, inspired by the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models</a>.</li>
<li>Implementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc.</li>
<li>Enhancing Shell-use &amp; Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1.
