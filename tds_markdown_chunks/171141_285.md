me and my friend both have same docker file code with missing flask dependency (i will try as much to not reveal his id/name) he got 12/20 even tough i tried same methods given by you and same error popped up flask module not found in his case but you gave him 12/20 marks but for me you gave 0? did i done something wrong? I know in industry level it matters much but right now we are students and for us CGPA matters.
