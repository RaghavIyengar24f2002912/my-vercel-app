When the system rebooted, I restarted the server and ngrok, which generated a new API endpoint as ngrok URLs are temporary and change with every session. The previous endpoint is no longer accessible, and the new one now serves as the API endpoint. I understand the need for a consistent URL and will explore solutions like reserving a domain through ngrokâ€™s paid plan to prevent such issues in the future. Apologies for any inconvenience caused, and thank you for understanding.</p>

<p>It seems you have provided a local address endpoint, which means it will only work on your computer.
