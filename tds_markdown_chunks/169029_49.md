Is it some thing like this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/" \

<p>In last question of GA5 there is only one file(image), table is not coming through file, it will be kept same for project2.</p>

<h4>21f2000709 (#70)</h4>
<p>So I was thinking to create the project 2 together and I was looking for collaboration, and for that we would require the following:</p>
<p> → the set of question-answers pairs at first<br/>
 → All the questions of 2 distinct students to see which parameters changes in each questions<br/>
 → Make the solution functional and parameterised based on previous step.</p>
<p>Till now I have created the following:</p>
<p> → Identification of the question, using embeddings<br/>
 → extraction of parameters using llm for that particular question<br/>
 → Implementation of 3 questions using this approach</p>
<p>If we come together, we all can reduce the workload and complete it on time.</p>
<p>*Those who resonate with my approach or have any different approach feel free to leave a DM.
