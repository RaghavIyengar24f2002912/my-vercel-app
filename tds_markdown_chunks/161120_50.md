Could you please help me identify any issues or clarify where I might be going wrong?</p><hr>

<p>Hi Shalini,</p>
<p>I deployed my code with your dataset and checked and checked answers for your dataset, so there is no errors in backend.</p>
<p>Since you are getting some output, it won’t help to look up to logs from vercel,  just check your code if it’s logically correct.</p>
<p>Kind regards<br/>

<p>Hello Sir,</p>
<p>I’ve been working on question 6 and I’m facing this error where the marks are not ordered properly. I believe my code appends the marks based on the names that are inputted in the backend but I’m unable to identify the source of this issue.
