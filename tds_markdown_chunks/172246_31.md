I’ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason?<br/>
As the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation?</p>
<p>Thank you and Regards<br/>

<p>Thanks for the clarification. I completely understand that bonus marks are at the discretion of the course team and are meant to reward diligence and deeper engagement — which is fair.</p>
<p>However, I just want to point out a potential nuance: Many of the 192 students who did GA7 may have done so <em>not</em> for extra learning but simply to ensure their top 4 GAs included 4 full scores (e.g., to replace a lower-scoring GA).
