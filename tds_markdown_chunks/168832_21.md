But due to internet issues, I could not submit exactly at 1:45pm.<br/>
My last submission was at 1:47pm. But if there was a auto save then you could already check my answers were in the portal.</p>
<p>I request you to please consider submission delays of 2-3 mins as this was due a technical glitches. And we too are switching tabs and running in vscode<br/>
</p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br/>

<p>Your answer is absolutely correct <a class="mention" href="/u/23f2000573">@23f2000573</a><br/>
But the problem is you had to submit the answer rounded off to 3 decimal places. A decimal more or less would result in a wrong answer.</p><hr>

<p>ROE was challenging, but definitely Mocks helped a lot. I think mocks were the best preparation for ROE. Did good because of it.</p><hr>
