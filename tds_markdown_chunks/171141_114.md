Because of this all the tasks failed. There also might be environment and configuration issues in my Dockerfile. When I tested locally, it worked fine but because of this small mistake I am now only getting 1/20. Is it possible to change/modify my code?</p>
<p>Thanks for considering, any help would be appreciated. Worked very hard for this</p><hr>
