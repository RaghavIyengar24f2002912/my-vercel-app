That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation.</p>
<p>I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate.</p>
<p>I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties—especially for a single oversight—can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and understanding.</p><hr>
