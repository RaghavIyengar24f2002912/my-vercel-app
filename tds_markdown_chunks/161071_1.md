<p>Hii all…i know this may not be the correct platform to ask this question.<br/>
Actually i have 3 diploma subjects to cover - MLP, JAVA, TDS. So which 2 subject should i choose for this term?</p><hr>

<p>Don’t take TDS, this subject should be taken in the end else you might have some problem</p><hr>

<p>TDS at the end best. Gives you the best chance of doing well in it.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p><hr>

<h4>Adityach1 (#4)</h4>
<p>Yes you should do tds after mlp only it really help you alot trust me</p><hr>
