The encodings are invisible just like in the original as well as in your clipboard when you copy paste into the GA.</p>
<p>Here is a json example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">json_answer = {
    "mary": "poppins",
    "age": 42
}

stringed_json = json.dumps (json_answer)
response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = {
"answer": stringed_json
}

response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator)

print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer'])
</code></pre>
<p>Look at the response. A perfect json.<br/>
</p>
<p>If you do not want spaces in the response then strip the spaces before you send the stringified response.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p><hr>

<p>The GA portal marks it as wrong unless I manually insert new lines. I hope that wonâ€™t be an issue, will it?</p><hr>

<p>Yes, it will.
