I do not need the exact answer; I just want to know if there is any issue with the portal for <strong>Q8</strong>.</p>
<p>Thankyou</p><hr>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/daksh76">@daksh76</a> thats because your innermost logic layer must not return a long list of results.</p>
<p>If you think about it logically each row cannot have a column field where one of the columns is a whole row of results right?</p>
<p>Thats why you are getting the error.</p>
<p>Check your innermost layer is returning a single value or a row of results.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p><hr>
