<p>All the image ids we evaluated were what <em>you</em> submitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos <em>you</em> gave us.</p>
<p>For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed.
