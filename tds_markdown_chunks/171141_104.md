<p>I recently received an email stating that my Docker image is not publicly available, resulting in a failed prerequisite check for the TDS Project 1. However, I have ensured that my Docker image is publicly accessible. Please help.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a></p>
<p>My Docker image ID is "<strong>99d08f2002fa</strong> ", and it is set to public. I kindly request you to review this issue, as I have worked very hard on this project and would appreciate the opportunity for a fair evaluation.</p><hr>

<p>The image id varies depending on the system it was built on. When we build it on our Xeon cloud compute it will get a different image id from yours (unless you have a Xeon system).
