In this case, would I have to implement GitHub OAuth flow?<br/>
If they donâ€™t send those details but just the email and I am expected to just change the email in my own repo and commit, in the worst case making the same change repeatedly may be misconstrued as a DDoS attack by an automated script which may lead to my GitHub account being suspended, which does not seem ideal.<br/>
Can you please at least hint at a solution?</p>
<p>Edit: Same query for the GitHub actions question (GA2 Q7)</p>
<p>Another edit: A similar query for GA2 Q8. Repeated dockerimage pushes to Dockerhub with different tags.</p><hr>
