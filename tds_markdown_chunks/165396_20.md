Only scores that were saved in your actual last submission on the ga page itself will be evaluated (the portal question is just to make sure you were aware of the GA and confirm that you attempted it).</p>

<p>Respected Sir,<br/>
I made the similar mistake of not selecting a yes on the seek IITM portal<br/>
According to your previous replies, does it imply that only the answers submitted through the link provided will be considered for evaluation regardless of the seek portal selection for this time?<br/>
Thanks</p><hr>

<p>Hello,<br/>
I accessed the assignment through the provided link and attempted and saved it. But unfortunately I forgot to submit it on my course LMS.
