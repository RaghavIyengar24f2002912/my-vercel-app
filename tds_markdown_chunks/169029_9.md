<p>You can deploy it anywhere, just test how it works on Heroku, if it works(send request to api endpoint to your application and it should respond with answer)</p>
<p>Kind regards</p><hr>

<p>Any question from first 5 Gaâ€™s can be there and you would need to analyze which question it is, you can use function calling or prompting as well.
