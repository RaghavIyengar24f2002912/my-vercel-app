unnecessary project statement.</p><hr>

<h4>23f2004837 (#24)</h4>
<p>I have few questions just going through the Project 2 problem statement.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are we supposed to use OpenAI api’s or locally/private hosted one?</li>
<li>Many of the questions need files or images or audio files as input, same api is expected to handle those also?</li>
<li>Can we work in a team and submit the project together?</li>
<li>If we are to use locally hosted llm system, our systems are not strong enough to run most of the good ones locally</li>
<li>Is it possible to get a TA to collaborate in our project as an observer?</li>
</ol>
<p>awaiting a response.</p>
<p>Thank you…</p><hr>

<h4>23f3001745 (#23)</h4>
<p>There are a total of 57 questions in all 5 GAs(18+10+9+10+10).<br/>
Due to so many different formats of accepting questions and solving them, my main question is:<br/>
Is the main essence of this project related to deciphering cryptic js code in order to scrape it?</p>
<p>Some other doubts are</p>
<ol>
<li>Some questions ask for you to access some hidden divs in the html page and use that for solving (like week 1 q11)</li>
<li>Some questions ask you for AIPROXY TOKENs (like week 3 q9)</li>
<li>Some questions required manual correction to get correct answers (like week 4 q2)</li>
<li>Some questions require file output (like week 2 q2)</li>
</ol>
<p>How do we account for this?
