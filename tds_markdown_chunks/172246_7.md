<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> sir ,</p>
<p>This would be a deviation from the grading format right sir? As some of us were proactive and closed the 4 GA requirement earlier, if such extra weightage is given to a certain  GA unannounced then how is it fair on the other students ?<br/>
Kindly consider</p><hr>

<p>same for me also …<br/>
Please consider all the GA for the calculation and give bonus based on the overall performance in GA’s instead of one GA.<br/>
