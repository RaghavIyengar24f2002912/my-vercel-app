<p><a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> I too had the same issue (image was run on wrong architecture) and filled the gform that was circulated. When should we expect to get our scores?</p>
<p>Thanks<br/>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@jivraj</a> Sir I received a mail like everyone that my git-hub repository is not public and not MIT licensed. I even filled the g-form correctly while submitting.<br/>
But I had fulfilled the above required criteria. Please look into this matter ASAP.<br/>
Here is my git repo link : [<a class="inline-onebox" href="https://github.com/23f1001415/llm_aa_tds_project" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub - 23f1001415/llm_aa_tds_project</a>].
