I noticed that I have been awarded zero marks, and I’m a bit confused because I had made sure that everything was in place.</p>
<ul>
<li>My GitHub repository was <strong>public</strong> at the time of submission.</li>
<li>I had included the <strong>Dockerfile</strong> as required.</li>
<li>I also added the <strong>MIT License</strong> to the project.</li>
<li>For your reference, I am also attaching a <strong>snapshot</strong> of the repository as it was during the submission time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given all these were in place, I would really appreciate it if you could provide a <strong>concrete reason</strong> for giving <strong>zero marks</strong>. I’m eager to understand what went wrong so I can avoid it in the future and improve myself.
