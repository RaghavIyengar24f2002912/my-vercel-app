I had got email saying please update endpoint because earlier endpoint was having problems. I had sent <a href="https://c7f6-150-107-43-5.ngrok-free.app/api/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://c7f6-150-107-43-5.ngrok-free.app/api/</a> as updated endpoint in google form on April 10th. Same day I had got around 9 requests on that endpoint around 4:56 PM. They were 200 OK requests on /api/ and 4 requests  were 307 redirect on /api. I presume they were from TDS team. Next day got email to shut off endpoint. I had tested endpoint locally and on ngrok. Both were fine. Was the updated endpoint in the google form evaluated?
