A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.</li>
<li><strong>The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly</strong></li>
<li>Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions</li>
<li>The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).</li>
<li>How limited the time is.</li>
