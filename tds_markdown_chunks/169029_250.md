But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries. </p>
<p>Then I thought—what if I manually mapped questions and answers using a <strong>static JSON structure</strong>? That quickly broke when users passed <strong>different parameters, different files</strong>, or queried in <strong>non-standard formats</strong> like “code -s” or “code -v”.</p>
<p>The next idea: write <strong>individual Python scripts per question</strong> from our Graded Assignments (GA1–GA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable.
