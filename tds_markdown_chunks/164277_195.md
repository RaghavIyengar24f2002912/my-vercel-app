<p>Everytime I run datagen.py for the A1 task, the data file gets downloaded in the C drive instead of the current project folder. I even tried to set the current project folder as the root directory but it still downloads the files in C drive and I cant seem to find a workaround this. Can someone please help with this issue. Thanks!</p><hr>

<p>In the evaluation.py there is an import require named from datagen import some stuff.<br/>
which means inorder to run the evaluation.py we need to manually bring the datagen.py in the working directoryâ€¦</p>
<p>Because in order to run the evaluation.py we need the datagen.
