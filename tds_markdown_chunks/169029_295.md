I just got the mail stating that my evaluation is complete and I can turn off my server.<br/>
However the Cloud Run logs show that all POST requests were made to the wrong end point.</p>
<p>The exact url I gave ends with “/api/” but every POST request was either made to “/api” which resulted in a 307 response or with “http” instead of “https” which resulted in a 302 response.
