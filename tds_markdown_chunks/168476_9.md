<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jkmadathil">@jkmadathil</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/bharathi">@Bharathi</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a><br/>
Could you please look into the above issue?</p>
<p>Additionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring:</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#p-599787-grading-concerns-1" name="p-599787-grading-concerns-1"></a><strong>Grading Concerns</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Final Course Score:</strong><br/>
T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F<br/>
(The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.)</p>
<p>From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students:<br/>

Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for Project 1 (<strong>deadline: 16th Feb 2025</strong>), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline.
