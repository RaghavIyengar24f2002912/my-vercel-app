<p>Is the marks shown on dashboard out of 20 or 100? coz i can clearly see in the logs that my api has answered all questions correctly, and my dashboard shows score of 20 for project 2.</p><hr>

<p>If u restart ngrok it changes endpoint every time. Your old endpoint is non existent as far as i know.</p><hr>
