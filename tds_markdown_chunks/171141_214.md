However, the final result I received today states that none of the tasks in Task A and B were working, and I was awarded only 1 bonus mark.</p>
<p>During my own testing, I was consistently getting 7/10 correct in Task A, so I’m a bit confused about the change.<br/>
Kindly request you to look into this discrepancy sir<br/>
Thank you</p><hr>
