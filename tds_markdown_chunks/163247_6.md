<p>Hi Nilay,</p>
<p>Yes you would need to use <code>text-embedding-3-small</code> model of openai for embedding questions.</p>

<p>i have a doubt, while submitting the GA3, both 7th and 8th questions require the API url to be active and connected right, but its not possible as both the URLs use same port, so if we check my 7th question URL is running right now, itâ€™ll show as correct, but then if i  run 8th question URL, the 7th question will automatically show the error, <strong>is there any solution to this problem?</strong></p><hr>
