<p>Respected Sir,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response and for providing the steps to replicate the test environment.<br/>
Steps Taken to Replicate the Test Environment<br/>
I cloned my repository using:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">bash
git clone &lt;my_repo_url&gt;
cd &lt;my_repo_directory&gt;
I built the Docker image using:

bash
docker build -t.
I ran the Docker container with:

bash
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000

I ensured that datagen.py and evaluate.py were placed in the same folder as instructed.

Finally, I ran the evaluation script using:

bash
uvicorn evaluate.py --email=&lt;any_email&gt; --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000
</code></pre>
<p>Issue with Original Submission<br/>
After reviewing the evaluation logs, I identified that the issue with my original submission was caused by binary incompatibility between pandas (version 2.0.3) and NumPy (version 1.24.3).
