<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> sir,</p>
<p>I wanted to bring to your attention that, although as you are already aware that I was present for the ROE and successfully submitted my exam, my dashboard currently reflects my status as “Absent.”</p>
<p>I have attached a screenshot for your reference. I assume this might be a backend issue or that the scores are still being updated.
