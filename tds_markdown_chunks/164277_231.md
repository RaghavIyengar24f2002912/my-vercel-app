<p>On my system evaulate.py is throwing an error on A2 trying to execute npx on format.md before the llm is even invoked. However running the command directly on the command line works.</p>
<p>evaluate.py:<br/>
 A2 failed: Command ‘[‘npx’, ‘prettier@3.4.2’, ‘–stdin-filepath’, ‘data/format.md’]’ returned non-zero exit status 2.</p>
<p> A2 FAILED</p>
<p>bash:<br/>
npx prettier@3.4.2 --stdin-filepath data/format.md</p>
<p>bash works as expected.
