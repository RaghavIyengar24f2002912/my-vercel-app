<p><a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> Please can you tell me whether my evaluation is done or not. For roll no: 22f2000946</p>
<p>If yes, I will stop my VM. I am running low on credits.</p><hr>

<p>It will be similar in case the top cumulative score after the ET is, say, 90… <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a></p><hr>

<h4>carlton (#436)</h4>
<p>Normalisation is only helpful when no one scores the top marks.</p><hr>

<h4>Yogesh1 (#435)</h4>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> Could you clarify if some kind of a normalisation will be done this time as well? Or if some bonus marks will be given? Last time, it didn’t help as much because the highest marks were 16.</p><hr>

<p>We cant specify a clear deadline.
