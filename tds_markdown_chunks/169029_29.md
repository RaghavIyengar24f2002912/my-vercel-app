So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment?</li>
</ol>
<p>Another concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from <a href="https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev</a> will be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then.</p>
<p>Please advise what we should do. please clarify Sir.</p><hr>
