<p>Is the proxy server down right now?<br/>
I am getting this error when I am accessing the endpoint:</p>
<p>{‘id’: ‘chatcmpl-Axq55TzulOVjHYuXYIhkRQzCC3PNl’, ‘object’: ‘chat.completion’, ‘created’: 1738824915, ‘model’: ‘gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18’, ‘choices’: [{‘index’: 0, ‘message’: {‘role’: ‘assistant’, ‘content’: …, ‘costError’: ‘crypto.createHash is not a function’}</p>
<p>Or, do I have to install crypto module?</p><hr>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> sir, I see that the project 1 timeline was changed from February 7 - 17, 2025 to January 17 - February 15 which undoubtedly is a good increase in duration. However, I have my GATE DA exam on Feb 15 and the exam center is unexpectedly far. So, I request you to consider pushing the deadline to at least Feb 16.
