I have attached both console and network screenshots. Hope these are the ones you were referring to. Sure, I will join tonight’s session and try to rectify the issue. Meanwhile will update here if i was able to resolve it.</p><hr>

<p>The issue might be with the IP address you’re using. Try using <code>127.0.0.1</code> and check if it’s the correct localhost IP for your machine. Also, test with <code>http://localhost:8000/api</code> to see if it works.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t solve the problem and you’re running port 8000 inside a virtual machine, use the <code>ipconfig</code> command to check the correct IP address.</p>
