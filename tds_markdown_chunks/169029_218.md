<p>It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.</p>
<p>Thankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’.</p>

<p>I am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither <code>respect</code> nor <code>kindness</code> is evident in your post.</p>
<p>But thank you for your feedback.</p>
<p>One final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that.
