Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application). Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty).</p>
<p>Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.)</p>
<p><strong>A word of caution:</strong> <em>(i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation)</em> Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task (<em>possibly your first task</em>) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task.
