Even a yes/no response for each would suffice.</p>
<p>GA1:<br/>
Q13 - Use GitHub: Since the parameter is just my email, this question <em>WILL NOT</em> be tested against any other email, right? So I can just have a repo with my email in it, right?</p>
<p>GA2:<br/>
Q2 - Compress an image: Should my appâ€™s response be like this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">{
     "answer": "base64_encoding_of_compressed_image"
}
</code></pre>
<p>Q3 - Host your portfolio on GitHub Pages, Q7 - Create a GitHub action, Q8 - Push an Image to Docker Hub: Similar to GA1 Q13, these too have my email or roll number as parameter. These too <strong>WILL NOT</strong> be checked against any other email, right?</p>
<p>GA3:</p>
<p>Can you please give an example of how questions of this GA will be sent in the request, especially any of Q1 or Q2 or Q5 or Q6 or Q7 or Q8 which have code-blocks containing text crucial to the question?
