Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.</p>
<p>With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning.
