I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt.</p>
<p>From the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn’t do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn’t cover all the essentials of a projects.
