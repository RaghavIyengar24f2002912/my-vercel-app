<h1>Issues In TDS And Replacement with another course</h1>
<h4>Rrishit (#1)</h4>
<p>The knowledge required by students to do TDS has been revised during recent terms. ( Mentioned that as per industrial standards/ needs).</p>
<p>Additional programming skills are required(in addition to Python) to follow the TDS Course. That means indirectly, one should complete many courses diploma in programming before doing TDS.</p>
<p>In such a case, how to drop the course Tools In Data Science(already registered) and get it replaced with another course to save time and without incurring financial losses(as dropping a course refunds only a certain percentage of fees amount paid for the course), and do it again later in terms.
