Hope this solves the issue.</p>
<p>Small doubt: Do i need to submit the google form again?</p><hr>

<h4>nayonika (#586)</h4>
<p>I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm.</p>
<p>Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?</p><hr>
