All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week.</p>

<li>
<p>Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p><hr>

<p>-Yes sir this project 1 is very tough for even 1 question a whole day is used.<br/>
<a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> Sir besides this project we have other subject graded assignments and MLP Project and MAD2 project.<br/>
Please sir it would be very beneficial for everyone, we have talked to other students also we are not able to even complete the 10 A tasks even with the evaluate.py rest aside Task B.<br/>
Please sir take this into consideration.
