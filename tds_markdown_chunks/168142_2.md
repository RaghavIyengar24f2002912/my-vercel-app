<p>Thanks for the answer <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a><br/>
Is it safe to assume that ROE is nothing but a “GA with extremely short deadline” since we don’t have proctors ? Or is the ROE more complex structured ?<br/>
P.S. I am not saying the questions will be hard or easy, just asking about structure.</p><hr>

<h4>Rishabh2 (#4)</h4>
<p>Sir questions will be of Numeeical type or MCQs type as in earlier batches it was MCQs??</p><hr>

<h4>carlton (#5)</h4>
<p>ROEs are always unique. They can be of any kind. We do not fix one method. Therefore its not possible to say what kind of questions will be there whether MCQ, MSQ or numerical or text etc.</p>

<p>The ROEs are not GAs with short deadlines.
