<p>Dear Sir <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a>,</p>
<p>Sir, please note that after the deadline I haven’t resubmitted the form but I have edited it (as the form was allowing editing till then). Now what exactly have I edited is just added a “/” at the end and that’s it and nothing more.
