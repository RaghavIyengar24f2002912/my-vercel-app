I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don’t think so that they really made any effort in our course.
