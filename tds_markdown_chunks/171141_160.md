At that time we gave students a time window to fix it.</p>
<p>We discussed it internally with <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> and he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it <strong>regardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not</strong> on the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build).
