<p>It the team wants to give bonus marks then why specifically to peer review week-7 ? Like all the GAs were equally important ! So please do something about this.</p><hr>

<h4>mahi.13 (#10)</h4>
<p>Exactly! This should have been informed beforehand.<br/>
It’s really unfair</p><hr>

<h4>23f2004837 (#9)</h4>
<p>same for me also …<br/>
Please consider all the GA for the calculation and give bonus based on the overall performance in GA’s instead of one GA.<br/>
