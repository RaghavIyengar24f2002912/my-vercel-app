<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> Sir, I would like to respectfully ask if this is some sort of April Fool’s joke, as it appears that the TDS team is still only verifying the presence of files in the git repository and checking the accessibility of the repository. I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0 Score.</p>
<p>I am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again.</p>
<p>Additionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues.
