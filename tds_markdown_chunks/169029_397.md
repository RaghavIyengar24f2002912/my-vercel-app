I have done the project and it would not be fair if it is not evaluated.</p>
<p>Thank you</p><hr>

<p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received a mail stating that our <strong>Project 2</strong> would be <strong>reevaluated between 11 PM and 2 AM tonight</strong>, and that the following endpoint would be used to test the API:</p>
<p> <a href="https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://project2llm-production.up.railway.app/api/</a></p>
<p>However, I have not seen any logs in Railway during that timeframe, and my score on the dashboard is still showing as <strong>0</strong>.</p>
<p>Could you please confirm if my URL was actually reevaluated?</p>
<p>Thank you!<br/>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a> I believe it is a bit late now, but my Programming Quiz score is being displayed as Absent, I remember very well that I got a 4 out of 10, but it has been displaying Absent for a very long time now.
