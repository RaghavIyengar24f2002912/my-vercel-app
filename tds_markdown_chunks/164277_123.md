<p>Output specifications will be detailed in the “task” sent to the endpoint.</p>
<p>Phase B is meant to be vague because if you can solve it, without an elaborate and gratuitous use of gpt function calling, then you can actually solve <em>all tasks using the same function</em> !</p>
<p>Kind regards</p><hr>

<p>Hi instructors and TAs,<br/>
For the different tasks in Phase B, I don’t have a clear idea of what type of a response you expect.</p>
<p>eg.</p>
<ul>
<li>Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database &amp; Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website &amp; Transcribe audio from an MP3 file - Do you want the query’s response on an output file like A10?
