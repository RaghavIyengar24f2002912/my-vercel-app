<p>Can you check the dashboard now, Iâ€™ve been informed by operations that the scores have been pushed.</p>
<p>GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual (i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city.</p>
