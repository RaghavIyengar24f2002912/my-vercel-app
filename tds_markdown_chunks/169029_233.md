<p>Dear <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@Carlton</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@S.Anand</a>,<br/>
I successfully deployed my project on Vercel, and it works perfectly when tested using curl commands. Each task installs its required packages and runs as expected. However, I encountered an issue with Vercel’s free version, which has a 250MB limit. While my project’s size without installed packages is approximately 34MB, the size exceeds the limit once packages like Pandas, NumPy, Pillow, Whisper, and Uvicorn are installed, causing the server to crash.<br/>
Could you kindly suggest any alternatives or solutions for this issue?
