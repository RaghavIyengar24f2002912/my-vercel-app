It would be great if you demonstrate it in today’s live session at 8pm. Otherwise next week is all about project 2 discussion.</p><hr>

<p>Thank you for the opportunity! However, I won’t be able to present the project in a public session as my <strong>Azure API URL would be exposed</strong>, and since it incurs <strong>costs per usage</strong>, I need to keep it secure.</p>
<p>I’d prefer a <strong>private meet</strong> to demonstrate the project. Please let me know if that can be arranged. Looking forward to discussing it!</p><hr>
