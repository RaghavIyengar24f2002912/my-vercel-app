I’m not sure what caused this problem, but I will share a screenshot to help diagnose the issue.<br/>

<p>Thank you so much <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> for taking time out and checking the records and considering my submission.<br/>

<p>Ok sir<br/>
Also I have realised the value of 28 seconds since my last submission (9/10) was at 1:47:28<br/>
I respect the rules of the exam and will be more careful in the future exams to avoid such technical glitches.</p>
<p>Thank you</p><hr>

<p>The questions were really similar to the GAs and mocks…I practiced them beforehand and had code snippets ready to use…so I guess that was helpful</p><hr>
