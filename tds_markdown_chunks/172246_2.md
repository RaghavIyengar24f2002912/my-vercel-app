<p>Yes, I also missed the same assignment due to pressure from other courses.<br/>
However, awarding a 5-mark bonus instead of a percentile-based system like GA4 seems quite different.<br/>
Is this information available to everyone <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> sir?</p><hr>

I hope you are doing well.</p>
<p>As per the grading document, we were informed that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would be considered for grading. However, there was no mention of bonus marks, and before the deadline, we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7.
