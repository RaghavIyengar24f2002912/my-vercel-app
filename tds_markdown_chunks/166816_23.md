<p>Mine too but only for GA2. I have submitted and ensured it was checked and saved the assignment on Ex website but it shows that I was absent.</p><hr>

<h4>23f1002223 (#34)</h4>
<p>I have completed and checked and even saved the assignment for GA2 and GA3, however it says that I was absent for both GA2 and GA3.</p>
<p>Please check my assignment and ensure that it has been corrected, since I have checked the website and I had submitted.</p>
<p>Thank you</p><hr>
