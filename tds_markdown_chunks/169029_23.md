To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB. Should i consider deploying elsewhere or change the approach?</p>

Yes, we encourage you to collaborate with others and collectively work towards solving this project. Even if you are going for the relatively easiest approach of Function Calling, it would require you to code about 50 functions to solve all your tasks.
