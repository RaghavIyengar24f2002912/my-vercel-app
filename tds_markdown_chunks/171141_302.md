<p>That way you will be able to identify why the error was occuring.</p>
<p>The specific error itself means:<br/>
Docker is trying to run the command uv inside your container, but it can’t find the uv executable — it’s not installed or not in the system PATH inside the container.</p>
<p>If you did not run evaluate.py as specified in our live sessions by recreating the test environment and then running evaluate.py then it would not have reflected how your dockerised application would work.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p><hr>
