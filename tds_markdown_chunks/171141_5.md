Your code did not produce consistent results.</p><hr>

<h4>22f3002933 (#7)</h4>
<p>I have noticed that my image was run on a <code>x86_64</code> architecture ( I can see my email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which is <code>ARM</code>. This is why I can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the <code>exec format error</code>.</p>
<p>This was never mentioned on which architecture machine, our images will be evaluated. I request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.</p><hr>

<p>My evaluation log file is missing, although I followed all the steps to generate the docker image correctly, it’s showing the server didn’t start for 5 minutes but when I uploaded it, it was working fine. Please help me out sir, I worked hard on the project. I’ll get a zero, but I made the submissions correctly. Some other student also got the “server didn’t start in 5 minutes” but he has an evaluation log file.
