I just have one sincere doubt:</p>
<p>As you mentioned, the intention behind the GA7 bonus is to reward extra effort in GAsâ€”but why are 5 bonus marks being added to the <strong>total course marks</strong>, instead of awarding <strong>15/100 of the total</strong> to those who did GA7 exceptionally well?</p>
<p>Students like me, who have consistently scored 100% in all GAs (excluding GA7) and have been actively participating in the Discourse forum from the beginning, seem to be left out.
