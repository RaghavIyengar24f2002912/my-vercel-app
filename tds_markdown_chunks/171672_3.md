The license file was named properly and contained the correct content.</p>
<p>However, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed — resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I’ve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly.</p>
<p>Here is my GitHub repo for your reference: <a class="inline-onebox" href="https://github.com/virajpitale/tds-project1" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1</a></p>
<p>I kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I’ve met all the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>
