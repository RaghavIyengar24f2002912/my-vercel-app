What is common is the dcoker hub image name and tag we used. We used the one you submitted on your form.</p>
<p>But the image id serves the same purpose. If you alter the dockerhub image, our image will no longer match the one from dockerhub. the image id sha will change. So do not worry about whether your sha matches our sha. It just acts as a way for us to make sure that we are consistently looking at the same image.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p><hr>

<p>Thanks for your quick response sir. I just wanted to clarify that my dockerfile was recognized by Docker, and my image was successfully built, so it seems that Docker itself didn’t have an issue with the filename.</p>
<p>However, I understand that the evaluation script might be case-sensitive and specifically looking for “Dockerfile” with an uppercase “D”.
