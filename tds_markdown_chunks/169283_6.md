<p>Yeahâ€¦Even I am facing the same issue. Out of the 4 options provided, 3 options are correct in my case both for Q1 &amp; Q2, but both these questions are single-choice questions. Kindly look into it and help us out <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> !</p><hr>

<p>I guess for both Q1 &amp; Q2, we need to find the option that is having stronger correlation (positive/negative). Please correct me if I am wrong.</p><hr>
