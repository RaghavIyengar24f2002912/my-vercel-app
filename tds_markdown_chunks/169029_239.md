Can you please reevaluate it now if it hasn’t been done yet. I actually tested it till 3rd of April and it was working fine. I don’t know what actually happened. Please do consider.</p>
<p>Actually in the free tier there are many issues. These issues are beyond our control and I request the TDS team to please consider this issue and please consider re-evaluating it if it has not been done yet as we had put in a lot of efforts.</p><hr>

<p>Also a better evaluation strat would be to submit the GitHub repo in the form(Else they can make changes to the repo, who checks the commit history?) and maybe conduct a 2 min demo where the student clones the repo and then you run the script?<br/>
I know many students are there but other subjects do it for project courses?</p>
<p>Maybe a helpful tip for next time</p>
<p>If i do fail and repeat this course.
