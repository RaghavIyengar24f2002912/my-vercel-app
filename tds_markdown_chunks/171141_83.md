<p><a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> sir, I have fixed my docker image issue that was causing the error. Please re-pull my docker image so that I can get score. Please consider me for re-evaluation. All the codes were correct, only issue was a glitch in the docker image.</p><hr>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My log file shows a “file not found” or “directory not found” error. Could you confirm whether <code>datagen.py</code> was executed inside the Docker container or on the host OS?
