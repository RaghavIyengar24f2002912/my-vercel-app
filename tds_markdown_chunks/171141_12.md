<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> Sir , my Docker image is built on Macbook M1 which as you know uses ARM64 architecture . But evaluated with x86_64 which caused the exec format error due to cross platform compatibility issues . I am kindly requesting you to re-evaluate the project once again .</p><hr>

<p>This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: d0f14a872042  , but i had never provided this docker image then how it get evaluated, also none of the docker image created by me has this id.</p>
<p>Please, look over it.</p>
<p>Regards,<br/>
