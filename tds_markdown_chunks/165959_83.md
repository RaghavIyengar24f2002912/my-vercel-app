This issue is specific to the year field.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I guess for the year part, there are certain series having multiple seasons, for which hyphenated “years” are given.</p>
<p>For the particular instance - <code>“2024–”</code>, it appears another season/part is announced, thats why it is written that way.</p><hr>

<p>Good idea <a class="mention" href="/u/23f2005138">@23f2005138</a> and thanks. I fixed this. The example now reads:</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="json"><code class="lang-json">[
  { "id": "tt1234567", "title": "Movie 1", "year": "2021", "rating": "5.8" },
  { "id": "tt7654321", "title": "Movie 2", "year": "2019", "rating": "6.2" },
</code></pre>
<p>… with the year and ratings quoted.</p><hr>

<p>Sir, In Graded Assignment - 4 &gt;&gt; Q2, the year I extracted appears as “2024,” whereas the expected value on the portal is “2024–”. I have manually adjusted several values based on the expected format.
