However, in my project directory, the<br/>
<code>main.py</code>   file is located in the   <code>app/</code>   folder, and the   <code>run.py</code>   file is in the root folder of the project, which is   <code>LLM_Automation_Agent</code>  . This structure allows the <code>run.py</code> file to run the project without any issues by calling the appropriate functions from <code>app/main.py</code>.</p>
<p>To run the project, the command I used is:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">python run.py
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>run.py</code> is placed in the root folder and not in any subfolder, it should properly execute the project without any errors, as it redirects the calls to <code>app/main.py</code>.</p>
<p>I believe the evaluation may have been incorrect because the project was not executed in the way it was intended.
