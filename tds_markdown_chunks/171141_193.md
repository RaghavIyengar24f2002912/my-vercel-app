Really!</strong></p>
<p>As for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I’ll be experimenting with— modalities.</p>
<p>PS: I’m not claiming it’s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects: <strong>thoughtful use of LLMs in agent design</strong>. At this point, I’m less concerned about the marks, I’m actually enjoying the thought joyride. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong><br/>
My approach doesn’t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates — much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework.
