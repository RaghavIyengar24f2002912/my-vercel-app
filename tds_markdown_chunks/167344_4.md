For example, the GitHub link of the datagen.py was incorrect and I was confused due to the code not generating the expected outcome.</p>
<p>The LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation guidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card number from the image is a sensitive information.</p>
<p>I am alright with it since the evaluation will be different.</p>
<p>Now, I am really well versed with the tools taught in these weeks. Thanking the whole TDS Team for this project which was very well designed. </p><hr>
