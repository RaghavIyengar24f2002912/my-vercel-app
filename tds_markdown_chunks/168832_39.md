I will be satisfied even if you consider my 2nd save rather than latest save. (1st save was a sample test to check if possible, so it was 0 marks but the 2nd save is under 1-2 min which may prove that i have done all that questions before)</p><hr>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/jayeshbansal">@Jayeshbansal</a></p>
<p>Until not clicked on save button answers getâ€™s checked at frontend side only. There is no way we can validate it after deadline.</p>
<p>I trust you would have solved few questions and also would have checked before deadline but clicking on save button was must to get submission evaluated.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p><hr>

<p>I have attempted all the questions in the ROE and solved few of the questions but i forgot to save the submission. At that time, I did not realize that I have not even saved once during the time.
