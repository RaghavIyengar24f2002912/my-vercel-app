<p>I guess for both Q1 &amp; Q2, we need to find the option that is having stronger correlation (positive/negative). Please correct me if I am wrong.</p><hr>

<p>Yeahâ€¦Even I am facing the same issue. Out of the 4 options provided, 3 options are correct in my case both for Q1 &amp; Q2, but both these questions are single-choice questions. Kindly look into it and help us out <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> !</p><hr>

<p>Dear Sirs, Can we have some response on these issues related particularly to the questions 1 and 2 of Graded Assignment 6. It looks like multiple options are correct in the given options. Any guidance or hint, on how to arrive at the right answer will be helpful.
