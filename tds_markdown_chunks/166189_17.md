<p>Your scores are evaluated on a site that is external to the seek portal and is not integrated with the seek portal. Therefore seek does not know if you have submitted or not and by default says that it has not been submitted because it cannot see your external evaluation. There will not be a fix for this for some time.</p>
<p>Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal.</p>
<p><strong>The scores will only be visible in the dashboard.</strong> Just ignore anything inside seek portal.
