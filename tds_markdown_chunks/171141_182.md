<p>No it won’t be considered. It was supposed to be running on 8000 port.</p><hr>

<p>oh so… is it going to be considered? like will i get some score other than a 0… am sorry for asking so much</p><hr>

<p>We reevaluated and found your submission was valid but it was running on a different port, 5000 but it was expected to run on 8000 port.</p><hr>

<p>but my evaluation log file was missing… so that would make it a 0 right..I have accepted my fate that it would be a 0 but just a lil hope </p><hr>
