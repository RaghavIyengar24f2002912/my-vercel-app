What is the value in the "answer" column of the CSV file?" \
  -F "file=@abcd.zip"
</code></pre>
<p>It is given that only one file arguement is passed , can there be a usecase where multiple files are sent , for example GA-5 10th question Image reconstruction where there could be one file be the image another could be separate file with mapping, Although mapping can be given with question as well,<br/>
But still can you please confirm if there will be only one file or there can be multiple files send to API?</p><hr>

<p>Thanks for your reply <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a><br/>
I’ve figured out the solution to that particular question.<br/>
The deadline is still a concern, as many issues were only resolved during recent sessions—similar to the project 1 workflow—and This time there are many other things in the pipeline ( viva’s and oppe’s )<br/>
Anyway, I will complete this course with valuable learnings, but many others have been seriously affected by it.</p><hr>

<p>Yes sending your GA answer as text as the JSON response can work if the question was not parameterized.
