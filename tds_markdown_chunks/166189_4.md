There will not be a fix for this for some time.</p>
<p>Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal.</p>
<p><strong>The scores will only be visible in the dashboard.</strong> Just ignore anything inside seek portal. The dashboard is where all your subject score cards exists.</p>
<p>As stated in multiple places on discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission. If your dashboard score does not match your final submission score on the assignment page, only then contact us regarding your marks.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p><hr>
