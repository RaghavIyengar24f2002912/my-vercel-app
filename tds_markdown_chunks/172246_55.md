And then try to argue with <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> , <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a> about fairness.</p><hr>

<h4>23f1001524 (#24)</h4>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> this is really unfair, on one hand you all are giving 0 to project 1 submission even because of slighest mistake and on the other giving free marks to students who attempted the GA7. Most of us were not able to attend the GA7 and it was not mentioned beforehand that we have 5 marks bonus for GA7.
