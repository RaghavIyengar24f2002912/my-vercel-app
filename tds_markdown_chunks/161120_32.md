So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly.</p>
<p>Also the live sessions on <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_h5u1jMeBCl1BquBhgunA4t08XAxsA-C&amp;si=NE4LEQe48XfzAYbc" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">youtube</a> will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing.</p>
<p>There will be session <span class="discourse-local-date" data-date="2025-01-20" data-email-preview="2025-01-20T14:30:00Z UTC" data-range="from" data-time="20:00:00" data-timezone="Asia/Calcutta">2025-01-20T14:30:00Z</span>â†’<span class="discourse-local-date" data-date="2025-01-20" data-email-preview="2025-01-20T16:30:00Z UTC" data-range="to" data-time="22:00:00" data-timezone="Asia/Calcutta">2025-01-20T16:30:00Z</span> which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries.</p>
<p>The session is in your course calendar and the meet link is <a href="http://meet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">meet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy</a></p>

While I understand why you might choose to use <code>flask</code> due to your familiarity with it,<br/>
the <code>http.server</code> library is just very simple to use.</p>
<p>The <strong>only extra line of code</strong> you would need inside your <code>get</code> request if you used the <code>http.server</code> library would be:</p>
<p><code>self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")</code></p>
<p>Try to rewrite your code using <code>http.server</code>  library so that your debugging for simple tasks like this is easy.</p>
<p>The boilerplate code for a <code>get</code> request using the <code>http.server</code> library was already given in Q6.
