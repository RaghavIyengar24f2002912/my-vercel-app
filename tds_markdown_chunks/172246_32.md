So the distinction between diligence-for-learning and diligence-for-grade-maximizing becomes blurred.</p>
<p>Now that bonus marks are announced <em>after</em> the deadline, those who already had 4 perfect scores and skipped GA7 based on the stated structure (top 4 out of 7) are essentially penalized for playing the game by the original rules — not for a lack of diligence or engagement.</p>
<p>I’m not questioning the bonus system itself, just pointing out that such surprises can unintentionally favor certain strategies over others — and more transparency around this in future terms might help students make better-informed decisions without second-guessing themselves later.</p><hr>

<p>Exactly my point, there is no mention about this.</p>
<p>Bonus marks should be added out of 15 and not above that for T score calculation.</p>
<p>Otherwise it SHOULD mentioned in Grading Document.</p><hr>
