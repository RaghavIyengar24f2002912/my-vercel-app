But I donâ€™t think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below.</p>
<ol>
<li>In GA 1 ques 13 and  GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI <code>gh</code>  which we have to install in the vercel instance using <code>apt</code> package manager.<br/>
But, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages.</li>
<li>In GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that?<br/>
Also after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install <code>ngrok</code> package.</li>
<li>In GA 2 ques 8,  uploading an image to Dockerhub requires <code>docker</code> package installed.</li>
<li>In GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance?</li>
<li>Many ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled.
