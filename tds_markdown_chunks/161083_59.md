<p>Hi Arnav,</p>
<p>I tried your script on your dataset.<br/>
Problem might be you are not executing <code>grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum</code> in correct directory, you would need to execute it from <code>all_files</code> directory also there should not be any extra file other than that gets generated.</p><hr>

<h4>Jivraj (#95)</h4>
<p>You need to submit whole json becausae In this image <code>headers</code> is part of response, not request headers.</p><hr>
