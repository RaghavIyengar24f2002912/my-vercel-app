I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph</li>
<li>ROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful.</li>
<li>There are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily.</li>
</ul>

<p>I dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didnâ€™t practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#p-614585-this-term-5" name="p-614585-this-term-5"></a>This term.</h2>
<p>I made sure that I do all the GAs properly.
