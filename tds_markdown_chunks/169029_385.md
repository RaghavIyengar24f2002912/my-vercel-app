<p>Sir, submitted the gform and also replied to the mail that I received about re-evaluation</p><hr>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> Please recheck my project 2 also as I got 0 on dashboard. I and my two friends made this together but he got 80 and I got 0, how is this possible?</p><hr>

<h4>carlton (#636)</h4>
<p>Yes todays ngrok you sent to jivraj is fine. Because old ones are invalid</p><hr>

<h4>GaURaVinDeX (#635)</h4>
<p>Ok. Because our gform of 10th April has old ngrok endpoint which isnt valid now. Only the one which we have emailed to <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> before 10:30 PM is current active.
