After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected:</p>
<p>The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes.</p>
<p>It responds to requests within the required timeframe.</p>
<p>I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository:<br/>
Docker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest</p>
<p>Request for Re-Evaluation<br/>
I kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process.
