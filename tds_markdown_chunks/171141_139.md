<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/lakshaygarg654">@lakshaygarg654</a></p>
<p>Dont worry you passed pre-requsites. The script that was used earlier for basic checks used a stricter criteria, the newer one we wrote allowed for a looser check. You have scored very well in your latest run. 12 correct tasks.</p>
<p>We have not responded quickly because we are in the midst of finalising all the scores and doing normalisation etc, i.e operational work for Project 1 and 2.</p>
<p>We hope to have Project 2 scores out by this weekend.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p><hr>
