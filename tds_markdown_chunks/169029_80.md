Even if you are not able to cover all the 58 questions, try to cover the majority of them, as the evaluation involves sending just 1-3 questions for evals.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> ( <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a> ) <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> , is it possible to extend the deadline by 2 days April 1st, since we can use the LLM api a little more and Most people(me atleast) have Their OPPEs and its combined syllabus (and the OPPE 1 did not go well, partly due to my inadequacies) , which has much more to cover, since this project involves more involved coding compared to the last project(ideally project one should have taken not more than a day , still messed it up though xD). Asking for extension for 2 days, if possible.
