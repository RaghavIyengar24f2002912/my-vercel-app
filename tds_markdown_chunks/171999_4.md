Error is in `response.error?.message`.
- Calculate embeddings with a POST request to `https://llmfoundry.straive.com/openai/v1/embeddings` with `Authorization: Bearer {os.getenv("LLMFOUNDRY_TOKEN")}` and this JSON body:
    {
      model: "text-embedding-3-small",
      input: [array of strings],
    }
  Embeddings are in response.data[*].embedding - an array of floats.
  Calculate the dot product of the embeddings (skipping the diagonal) to find the most similar pair of strings.

client.post(
            f"{openai_api_base}/embeddings",
            headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {openai_api_key}"},
            json={"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": data},
        )
