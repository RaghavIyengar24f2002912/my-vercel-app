Specifically, I would like to understand why only those who completed GA7 are receiving the bonus marks email regarding peer reviews.</p>
<p>Please note that I ask this purely for clarification and with the utmost respect for the professors and the grading system, as I have no intention of creating controversy. I simply wish to understand the criteria.<br/>
Thank you for your time and consideration <a class="mention" href="/u/jkmadathil">@jkmadathil</a> sir.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br/>

<p>Greetings!</p>
<p>I came across your response in the Discourse thread regarding the bonus marks and GA7, and I wanted to reach out respectfully to seek some clarification.</p>
<p>I did go through the grading policy and the bonus marks section, but I’m still a bit confused about your message in the thread — especially regarding the specific steps we should take or refer to in order to understand the bonus marks related to GA7 and peer reviews.
