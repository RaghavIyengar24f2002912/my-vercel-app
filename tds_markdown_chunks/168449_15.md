<h4>shubhamatkal (#19)</h4>
<p>Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> sir , for me given constituency was <code>"SRI GOBINDPUR"</code><br/>
and in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over the period names were changed of this constituency<br/>
i have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">df_gobindpur = df[df["AC"].str.contains("SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR", case=False, na=False)]
</code></pre>
<p>is this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only?
