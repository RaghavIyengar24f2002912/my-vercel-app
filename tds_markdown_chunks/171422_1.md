<h1>Project 2: How to test questions from the GA's</h1>
<h4>Aryxn (#1)</h4>
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I have completed a working project of P2, but I want to test it out with actual questions from the GA’s. Is there anyone that can provide with sample question structure, or 1 or 2 questions as a form of ‘test cases’ so that we can try and fix our project?</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance<br/>

<p>You can do a curl post request or use something like Thunderclient or Postman. If you used fastapi then in the /docs path of your link you will find the open API user interface which you can also use for testing.</p><hr>
