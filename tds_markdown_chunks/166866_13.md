<p>and othersâ€¦</p>
<p>I have discussed this with the rest of the TDS team and with Operations on multiple occasions (including today.) Here are the highlights of the discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday.</li>
<li>All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago)</li>
<li>Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago)</li>
<li>We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1.
