Had I known this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly, and the app responded to all queries as expected.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully to my overall score. I would be extremely grateful if you could look into my case and extend your support in this matter.</p>
<p>Thank You and Regards,</p>
