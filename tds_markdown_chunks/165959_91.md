Converting the pdf to markdown and getting the correct output is extremely hard, I tried doing that multiple times yet wasnâ€™t able to get that right by the original method.</p>
<p>But since it is mentioned that the GAA is hackable and we are allowed to do so, for some of the questions, therefore you can try solving that by establishing a breakpoint in the sources and then write the code in the console to get the expected output.</p><hr>

<p>Double-check that the rating field in the JSON is indeed a float (<code>2.9</code>) and not a string (<code>"2.9"</code>) in your code.</p><hr>

<p>I face the same error, also thinking of issueDate, the value seems to be constant in every loop inside forecasts array (is it because the data is issed on that particular date) that gives same issue date key across the json outcome.
