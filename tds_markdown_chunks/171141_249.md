<p>What I observed is that most of the repositories appear to be copied from a single source. This original repository contains several issues, such as an incorrectly named Dockerfile and missing instructions to copy all necessary data. Unfortunately, many students seem to have uploaded it blindly without reviewing or fixing these problems.</p><hr>

<p>Thanks for the response. We can go on endless discussions using “nice words” “professionally” with the number of questions we have. Finally we are at the receiving end as students in this setup.</p>
<p>What’s the take away for everyone? Let’s move on.
