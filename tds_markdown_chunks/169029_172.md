<p>I completely understand the need to keep evaluations on schedule. In that case, would it be possible to grant just a one-day extension? I’ve completed up to Week 3 and just need a little extra time to wrap up Weeks 4 and 5 properly.

<p>We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed.</p><hr>
