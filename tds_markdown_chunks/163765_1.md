<p>Despite saving multiple times, my score keeps resetting to zero. Should I refill the answers for all the questions before saving again? Could this issue also be caused by accessing the assignment from multiple devices?</p><hr>

<p>Hi Shalini,</p>
<p>We are aware of the issue and <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> is working on a solution. The temporary fix is to just reenter all the answers before hitting the Save button. Thanks for the reminder, please bear with the inconvenience while its being fixed.</p>
<p><strong>The last submission is always saved. So please make sure that your last submission contains all the answers for all the questions.</strong></p>
<p>Kind regards</p><hr>

I am also facing the same issue. In my last submission the score was 7.25.
