<p>Hi Aindree,</p>
<p>I tried to send a request to your application <code>https://your-app2.vercel.app/api</code> with url encoded parameter <code>class=7Q</code>. It should fetch marks of that particular class. But in response it sends <code>{"marks": []}</code>.</p>
<p>Check if your csv file is correct.
