I found that the issue was happening because of the http and https proxies being set in docker build</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">ARG http_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.&lt;xxx&gt;.com:80
 ARG https_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.&lt;xxx&gt;.com:80

ENV http_proxy=${http_proxy}
 ENV https_proxy=${https_proxy}
</code></pre>
<p>This was required  as my office environment was behind the proxy and it was required for uv to download the dependencies on startup..</p>
<p>So this had caused the image to run in my office environment and not in orchestrator environment..
