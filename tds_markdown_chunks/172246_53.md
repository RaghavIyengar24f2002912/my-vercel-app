For ROE and the Week 4 GA, bonus marks were mentioned here on Discourse</p>
<p>Could you kindly guide me on what exactly we should refer to (such as any email, document, or past policy) and what steps are expected from us to be eligible for the bonus?<br/>
Also, would students who completed all 5 assignments (but missed GA7) have any alternative way to earn bonus marks through peer reviews or other contributions?</p>
<p>Apologies if Iâ€™ve missed something already mentioned.
