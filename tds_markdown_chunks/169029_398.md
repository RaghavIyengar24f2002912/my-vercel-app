<p>can you send this email which is there in screenshot to me(22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) ?</p>
<p>If that proof you can give we will consider reevaluating.</p><hr>

<h4>afsalshah (#648)</h4>
<p>I understand your point, Sir. It was a mistake on my part, but if possible, I kindly request you to consider my submission given the circumstances.</p><hr>

<h4>Jivraj (#647)</h4>
<p>We didn’t account for such cases. The purpose of that form was to reevaluate only those who submitted using their IITM email but had provided the wrong endpoint.</p>
<p>Anyone who didn’t use their IITM email during submission—even if they later filled out the form—was filtered out and not considered for reevaluation.</p><hr>

<h4>afsalshah (#646)</h4>
<p>Sorry, Sir. I just realized the reason why my submission was not considered — I had used the email ID I created specifically for my MAD2 project.
