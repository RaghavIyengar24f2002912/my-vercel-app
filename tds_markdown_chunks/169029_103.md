I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment &amp; Portal Limitations:</strong><br/>
There are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning.</li>
<li><strong>Time Constraints:</strong><br/>
Balancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments.</li>
<li><strong>Sessions &amp; Support:</strong><br/>
The sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment Variability:</strong><br/>
Each GAâ€™s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform.
