<p>I hope this message finds you well <a class="mention" href="/u/jkmadathil">@jkmadathil</a> sir.</p>
<p>Firstly, I would like to sincerely apologize for any misunderstandings that may have arisen. I have the utmost respect for the grading system and for the esteemed professors at IITM, and I deeply value the effort put into the course.</p>
<p>However, as a student, I am hoping to clarify the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course.</p>
<p>Addressing the queries you raised in your post:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>What is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>In previous modules, such as Project 1, bonus marks were awarded for completing additional tasks (1 bonus mark per task if the code handled them correctly). Similarly, in GA4, bonus marks were given for replying in Discourse.
