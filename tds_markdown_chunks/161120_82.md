Right now, the questions are marked correct and I’ve saved the assignment. Since the servers won’t always be running, I hope this won’t cause a problem during evaluation.</p><hr>

<p>Hi Srividya,</p>
<p>Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints.<br/>
When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs.</p>
<p>This renders <code>name == main</code> part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it).</p>
<p>In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all.
