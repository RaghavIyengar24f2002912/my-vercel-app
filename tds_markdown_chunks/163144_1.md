<h1>Way of conduction of exam</h1>
<h4>Divya1 (#1)</h4>
<p>My doubt is that “Will there be any coding level questions in the ROE and the weekly graded assignments?”</p><hr>

<h4>ADI_1792 (#2)</h4>
<p>In ROE , usually you have to find the answers of the questions by solving them using codes and tools explained in the course .</p>
<p>For example you have a large pdf file of some patients and their disease and you are said to find number patients having some XYZ disease in that pdf . Now you can get this answer by using parsing tools and few lines of codes and after getting the results you can write that answer back in the portal .</p>
<p>Same goes for assignments , they will be more like minor project works.</p><hr>
