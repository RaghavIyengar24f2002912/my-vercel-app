<p>Good Morning Sir, Actually even I got the mail regarding Project-1 Evaluation, where I got the message like the prerequisites were not met. But, sir actually I have uploaded my MIT License file, requirements.txt file, my Project.py file and the Dockerfile. Sir, and when I sent a request to my API from my device, it worked sir.
