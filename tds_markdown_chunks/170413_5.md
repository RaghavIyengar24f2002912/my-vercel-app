<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> ,</p>
<p>Will this session be recorded and shared later?<br/>
It conflicts with live session of BA and that session is specially told that It will not be recorded.</p><hr>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> sir, I too prefer a recording. I did not even attend the session due to personal work which I couldn"t avoid.
