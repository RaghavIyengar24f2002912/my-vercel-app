While running the evaluation.py i am facing several issues because my output isnt strictly adhering sometimes to it will the checking be on such a basis only</p>
<p>for example in A3<br/>
 EXPECTED:<br/>
129<br/>
 RESULT:<br/>
“129”<br/>
this is the error i get while it is the function in eval.py checking problem as it gets response as text and doesnt strip (“”)</p>
<p>Please guide what should i do</p><hr>

<p>actually that easyocr is directly sending the clear text(no confusion) to llm and llm is just extracting the  exact numbers from it .</p><hr>

<h4>23f2001975 (#207)</h4>
