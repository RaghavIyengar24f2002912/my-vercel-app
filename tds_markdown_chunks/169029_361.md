<p>Sir i also did the same mistake and am truly sorry for what i did but it is my dearest request if you can look into this matter as it is very essential that the project is evaluated.<br/>
I am once again very sorry for the mistake</p><hr>

<p>Respected Carlton Sir,<br/>
I thought in gform we need to submit the deployment url:</p>
<aside class="onebox allowlistedgeneric" data-onebox-src="https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/">
<header class="source">
<a href="https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app</a>
</header>
<article class="onebox-body">
<h3><a href="https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">TDS Solver</a></h3>
</article>
<div class="onebox-metadata">
</div>
<div style="clear: both"></div>
</aside>
<p>but for the API testing we need to add /api/ to the url:</p>
<p><a class="onebox" href="https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/api/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://tdsproject2-eight.vercel.app/api/</a></p>
<p>Please do my evaluation on this link, its the same just we need to go to /api/ in the URL</p><hr>

<p>I sincerely apologize for not using my official email address — it was an honest oversight and not an attempt to bypass any rules.
