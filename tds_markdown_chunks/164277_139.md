<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> sir! Is this video (Week-5 Session-3) the continuation video from the previous session (Week-5 Session-1), since the Session-2 video has not been recorded and uploaded. I am totally relying on these videos to complete the project sir. Please help me out!</p><hr>
