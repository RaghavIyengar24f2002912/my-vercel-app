I know you will release it once everything is processed correctly. My concern was only about getting a response. Anyway, thanks for replying.</p>
<p>Also, today’s session has been canceled. I wanted to ask about the issue with editing responses in the Project 2 form. Is there any update on this?</p><hr>

<p>If you used openai’s python module then you were needed to pass your own api key, hardcode it in code.</p>
<p>API key that we were sending was only valid through proxy server created by professor anand.</p><hr>
