How it was evaluated?</p>
<p>This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 0ade87d1bf07</p>
<p>My terminal shows 2 images as last, with respective image ids. I am not sure which one is the real, so please check with both the ids.<br/>

<p>I am requesting to look into this case. I think there has been some mistake somewhere.</p>
