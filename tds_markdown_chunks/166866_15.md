<p>Kindly consider the request and extend the deadline sir. It would be really helpful as we could atleast work upto our full potential and submit few tasks increasing the odds of our submission. <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a></p><hr>

<p>Please at least make it 16 or 17 Feb. The GATE DA exam and project deadline coinciding has already hampered progress on both ends.
