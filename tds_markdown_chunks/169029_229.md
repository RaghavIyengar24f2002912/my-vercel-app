<p>My project is hosted on render, because vercel refuses to cooperate with me, as a result the free version of render takes a minute to respond, and not only that but might also give internal server error until the 2nd or 3rd try. There is nothing I can do to change this except for maybe sending requests every now and then like it was suggested for another student using render.
