<p>To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system.</p>

</aside>
<p>Here is my response, and I have consulted with the course instructors before sharing this:</p>
<p>Every term in TDS, both instructors and students are not aware of what bonuses are going to be given out at the start of term. Bonus activities are created at any point, at the discretion of the course team, and the information is not disseminated in a wide fashion. Itâ€™s primarily a reward mechanic for those that really are interested in engaging in the whole breadth of the course.
