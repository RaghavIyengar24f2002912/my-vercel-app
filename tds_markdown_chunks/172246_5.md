Since this information was not communicated earlier, we kindly request you to consider providing an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn these bonus marksâ€”perhaps through reviewing submissions or another form of assessment.</p>
<p>We sincerely request your understanding on this matter and would be grateful if you could provide an opportunity for us to earn the bonus marks as well.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your kind consideration.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br/>

There seems to be a sudden and unannounced change in the GA marking scheme, which feels quite arbitrary.
