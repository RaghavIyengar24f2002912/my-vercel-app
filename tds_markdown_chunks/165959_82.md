<p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/21f2000709">@21f2000709</a> for this information. I figure out where i made mistake. During writing console code I added to remove non numeric values in year field which i guess removed that hyphen (“–”). I will rectify that.</p><hr>

<p>In Graded Assignment - 4 &gt;&gt; Q2, the year I extracted appears as “2024,” whereas the expected value on the portal is “2024–”. I have manually adjusted several values based on the expected format.
