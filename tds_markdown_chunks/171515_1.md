<h1>GA7: Peer Grading Clarification</h1>
<h4>22f2000644 (#1)</h4>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> Sir, I want to clarify something about the peer grading process. Some of the files of the student assigned to me are not accessble and others are missing. How am I to grade each thing? From what I understand analysis must be graded based on the shared files but if im not able to access them what should I do? I think requesting view access might violate the spirit of the grading exercise.</p>
<p>Please help me out on what to do.
