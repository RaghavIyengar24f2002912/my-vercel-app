Would like your thoughts and suggestions over the same.</p>

<li>
<p>Currently answers that we have entered for GA’s 1 to 4 are not available and only for GA5 its available. It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we’ve entered as well for verification purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question?
