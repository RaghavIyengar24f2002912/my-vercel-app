This screenshot is taken from the datagen.py file sent in yesterday’s results mail.</p>
<p>So, will it be possible to re-evaluate my task A1, A8, A9 and A10? At least A9 and A10 did not even get the files to work on as they weren’t even created due to insufficient error handling in datagen.py .</p>
<p>Also, can you help me to identify the cause of even the Pillow default font not being available? I don’t understand how a font not being available could be caused by my code.</p>
<p>Thank you</p><hr>

<p>Sir the evaluated docker file ID was mentioned as  5b28fd5b25a7 in the mail sent by you but my docker file ID is 4d8c0cc34e35. I think my docker file is not evaluated properly. Kindly do check this and help me out.
