I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects.</p>
<p>Since this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just two suggestions</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>I feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites.</li>
<li>While introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us.</li>
