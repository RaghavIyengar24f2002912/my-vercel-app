</ol>
<hr/>
<p>I genuinely hope someone is able to complete <strong>all 57 questions</strong> successfully—I’d love to learn from their experience and solutions.</p>
<p>Again, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know—I’m happy to edit or delete the post if needed.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for the learning opportunity</strong></p><hr>
