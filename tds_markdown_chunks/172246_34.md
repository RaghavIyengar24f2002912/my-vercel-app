Don’t we deserve some recognition for our consistent efforts too?</p>
<p>It’s not about jealousy—it’s about acknowledging those who have put in their day and night from the start, completing every GA diligently and earning bonus marks as per the criteria already defined for earlier GAs.</p>
<p>I’m only concerned about <strong>my own marks</strong>, and I just wish for a fair system that values consistent effort across the term.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and understanding.<br/>

<p>Thank you for sharing the data <a class="mention" href="/u/jkmadathil">@jkmadathil</a> Sir</p>
<p>The data clearly supports my assumption that the majority of students attempted GA7 primarily to secure 100% in GAA, or  to boost their GAA scores, with learning being a secondary priority.<br/>
Anyway, it is what it is.<br/>
Thankyou Sir</p><hr>
