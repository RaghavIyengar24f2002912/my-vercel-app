Since this information was not communicated earlier, we kindly request you to consider providing an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn these bonus marksâ€”perhaps through reviewing submissions or another form of assessment.</p>
<p>We sincerely request your understanding on this matter and would be grateful if you could provide an opportunity for us to earn the bonus marks as well.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your kind consideration.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br/>

<p>Yes, I also missed the same assignment due to pressure from other courses.<br/>
However, awarding a 5-mark bonus instead of a percentile-based system like GA4 seems quite different.<br/>
Is this information available to everyone <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> sir?</p><hr>

Sir, I have a query about the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course.
