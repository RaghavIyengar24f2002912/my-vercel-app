<h1>ROE timing overlaps with Java OPPE</h1>
<h4>Nelson (#1)</h4>
<p>On 2nd March, I have both Java OPPE and TDS ROE.<br/>
My Java OPPE timing is: 9:30 to 11:00 AM<br/>
MY TDS ROE timing is: 10:30 to 11:15 AM</p>
<p>A minimum gap of one hour is recommended.</p>
<p>I have written to support.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> Please look into this.</p><hr>

<p>I guess roe time is 13:00 to 13:45 and it is same for all , also check calender for the same.</p><hr>

TDS ROE is at 1pm in the afternoon for everyone.</p><hr>

<p>Apologies for the confusion. I realized that the issue was due to different time zonesâ€”Java OPPE displayed IST (GMT +5:30), while TDS ROE showed AST (GMT +3).
