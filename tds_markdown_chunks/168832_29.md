While the recent scores say I have a score of 10, my final score shows 0. Kindly look into this, and please consider the highest marks from recent saves.<br/>
Thank you.</p><hr>

<p>I  am Gudivada Abiram(21f3002158). In my todayâ€™s ROE exam I forgot to click the save button. My score initially was 6/10. I was tackling another question and by that time the timer went off.
