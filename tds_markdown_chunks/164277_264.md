I was able to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate everything thoroughly.<br/>
Therefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead.</p>
<p>I sincerely appreciate everyone’s guidance and support.</p><hr>
