<p>Hello Gentlemen Instructors,</p>
<p>In all the video lectures, I am first required to download the tools, install them on my computer ? Is it not going to overload my computerâ€™s RAM etc.,<br/>
In one of the classes, you said that there is something  - colab like cloud wherein we can go and practice without overloading our own computers.
