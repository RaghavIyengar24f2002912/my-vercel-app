<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> !</p>
<p>I am reaching out with deep frustration and concern regarding the evaluation of my project. I have worked tirelessly on this for almost two weeks, dedicating day and night to ensure that the tasks were executed correctly. During my own testing, I was able to get at least 7 out of 10 A tasks working as expected.
