<p>Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.</p>
<p>Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh.
