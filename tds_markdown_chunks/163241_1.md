<h1>Regarding EXTRA MATERIAL/INFORMATION/RESOURCES for the upcoming project</h1>
<h4>23f1002382 (#1)</h4>
<p>I recently explored the details of the extra credit project and found the problem statement and its clever framing both fascinating and challenging. While I’m eager to take it on, I feel my current skill set might fall short of the project’s demands. I’m committed to pushing my boundaries and would greatly appreciate your guidance on topics or resources that could help me prepare more effectively during my free time.</p>
<p>I want to ensure I can contribute something meaningful and engaging, even if the outcome isn’t perfect.
