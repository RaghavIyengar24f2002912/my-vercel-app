<p>Yes, I got <strong>great marks</strong> in Assignments, ROEs, and Project 1.<br/>
But let’s be real…</p>
<p>It was <strong>my Labrador</strong> who did the actual work </p>
<p>While I was snoozing through deadlines, he was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solving <strong>deployment issues</strong> faster than my dev server boots</li>
<li>Writing <strong>function calling code</strong> like a true GPT whisperer</li>
<li>Fixing <strong>LLM bugs</strong> that I didn’t even understand</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, I was just vibing in my blanket.<br/>
He growled at broken APIs.<br/>
I took the credit.
