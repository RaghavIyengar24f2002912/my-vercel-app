It defeats the learning process.</p>
<p>If you want solutions, there are several options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it)</li>
<li>Collaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration)</li>
<li>Join live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked)</li>
<li>Watch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q &amp; A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment)</li>
</ol>
