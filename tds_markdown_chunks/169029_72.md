<p>You won’t be required to update someone else’s repo.<br/>
Any github name, repo name is fine.<br/>
Just that it should have github pages with that particular email address.</p>

<p>If they don’t send those details but just the email and I am expected to just change the email in my own repo and commit, in the worst case making the same change repeatedly may be misconstrued as a DDoS attack by an automated script which may lead to my GitHub account being suspended, which does not seem ideal.<br/>
Can you please at least hint at a solution?</p>

</aside>
<p>In evaluation we will only send request one worst case twice or thrice if it fails from our end, so no issues with that.</p><hr>

<p>For GA-1 question 10,<br/>
we need to get the hash of the json, from the site <a class="inline-onebox" href="https://tools-in-data-science.pages.dev/jsonhash" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">JSON Hash</a>,<br/>
I found that underneath it using sha-256 in a function inside the encrypt.js file but still when I implemented the same in python, it is giving a different hash.
