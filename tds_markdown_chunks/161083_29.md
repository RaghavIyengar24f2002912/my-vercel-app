SQLite question.<br/>
It gives the error:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Error: Got [[121510.39]]...

</code></pre>
<p>Is it possible to have a more descriptive error? It’s a simple SQL query. I tried various options in my query. I didn’t succeed. </p><hr>

<p>It might be because you are not adding up the correct tags with attribute <code>data-value</code>. There may be other tags within the same DOM and having the attribute <code>data-value</code>.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p><hr>
