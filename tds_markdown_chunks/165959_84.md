This issue is specific to the year field.</p>
<p>I use different classes to extract values for various fields. Could there be any other element on the portal affecting this extraction?</p>
<p>In Q4, one of my classmates is encountering a “root property” error despite using the same extraction method as I do. Upon checking, I found that this issue occurs because the city’s time is displayed as the previous day compared to our time.
