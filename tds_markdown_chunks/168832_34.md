Given that you submitted 30 seconds past 1:47, we won’t be able to consider it.<br/>

<p>Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> sir,</p>
<p>Will it be possible to consider only the minutes. I also cannot control the technical delays. I raised the point as fast as possible and I also joined the technical GMEET and exited when a different person raised the same question.</p>
<p>I would dearly propose to consider still 1:47. But if it’s 1:48 you can ofcourse not consider it.
