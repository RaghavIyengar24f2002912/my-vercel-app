<p>I noticed that <strong>test cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python &amp; Shell use</strong>. While it would’ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the <strong>inherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads</strong>. No two payloads are exactly alike — even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably.
