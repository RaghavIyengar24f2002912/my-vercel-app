Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance<br/>
Whose options provided are :<br/>
10418 meters</p>
<p>12287 meters</p>
<p>10965 meters</p>
<p>11149 meters</p>
<p>However, after trying all methods out there my distance comes out to be 6873 meters, I selected 10418 as the answer (closest approximation to 6873 meters)</p>
<p>I assume that the question must have been central command post to summit shores village (whose answer turns out to be 12287 meters)<br/>
Kindly look into the question, and let me know about the same (the destination from central command post)</p><hr>
