<h4>AYUSH_SINGH (#16)</h4>
<p>My evaluation log file is missing.<br/>
The 2 other log files i’m given doesnt have my email inside it listed.<br/>
the Image id which is given in the MAIL is not present in my docker desktop, my project’s docker image is listed in docker desktop, which doesnot matches the image id given in the MAIL,<br/>
What was evaluated?
