<p>I was unable to make the answer box in Question 3 visible. I was only able to make white space appear there, but couldnâ€™t make it so that answer can be input to the box.</p><hr>

<p>Hello, could anyone please confirm that GA 3 is worth 9.5 points? Since our GAs are typically 10 marks apiece, I wanted to inquire about and obtain clarification on this.<br/>
Thank you in advance.</p><hr>

<p>Hi Shalini,</p>
<p>Your <code>user_message</code> is incorrect. I looked at your exact GA and it works if you make sure your <code>user_message</code> is precisely what is given to you.</p>
<p>Hint: How do you store a multi-line variable in python?</p>
<p>Kind regards</p><hr>
