<p>it usually happens in some GNU/Linux OS. since you are using some distribution based on Debian namely Ubuntu or whatever try doing sudo apt install python-packagename (replace package name with fastapi for fastapi)<br/>
then it works. It usually happens due to manual intervention with pip3 the user might break some system dependencies which require some python3 package.
