<p>No, we won’t be able to access your images from your local machine address.</p><hr>

<h4>Saransh_Saini (#207)</h4>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/algsoch">@Algsoch</a> We should receive your images as base64 encoded within your response JSON object.</p><hr>

<h4>Algsoch (#206)</h4>
<p>means {‘answer’:‘E://data science too//GA5/output/vicky.jpg’} right or we have to do you said output as base64</p><hr>

<h4>Saransh_Saini (#205)</h4>
<p>I am going to clarify this once and for all<br/>
The response should be a <strong>JSON Object</strong> with the value of the <code>"answer"</code> key as a string.</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="python"><code class="lang-python">{ "answer" : "YOUR_ANSWER_AS_STRING" }
</code></pre>
<p>This is the way we are expecting your responses.<br/>
However, due to the heavy confusion among students and will be considering responses with entire JSON objects stringified.
