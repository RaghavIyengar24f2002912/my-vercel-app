<p>ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.</p>
<p>Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.<br/>
The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.<br/>
<em>The problem is the lack of time.</em></p>
<p>So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand.</p>
<p>Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.</p>
<p>Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions.
