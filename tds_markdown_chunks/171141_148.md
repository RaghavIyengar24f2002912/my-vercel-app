This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything.</li>
<li>Adding useful API endpoints, including an <strong><code>/api/</code></strong> multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing <strong><code>/read</code></strong> and <strong><code>/run</code></strong> endpoints from Project 1, plus a <strong><code>/clear</code></strong> endpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated.</li>
<li><strong>Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP</strong>, utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up.</li>
</ul>
