In the results shared earlier, I was informed that my evaluation log file was missing. Later, a Gform regarding the architecture was sent, which I filled and submitted. Now, the final result I received today, shows that the taskA module is missing and I’ve been given a bonus of 1 mark.<br/>
I kindly request you to look into the matter and provide an explanation and solution in this regard.<br/>
Thank you.</p><hr>

<p>Respected sir,<br/>
I have passed all pre-requisites however my file wasn’t evaluated due to port error (127.0.0.1). Please allow me rectify it as it everything else has passed and is in accordance to the guidelines and I had worked really hard for it not to be evaluated only.</p><hr>
