The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system.</p>

<p>To automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page’s availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10–20 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process—from initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live—takes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine.</p>

<p>However, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly—before the GitHub Pages site is actually live—resulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a <strong>502 Bad Gateway</strong> error, likely due to Azure’s request timeout limitations.
