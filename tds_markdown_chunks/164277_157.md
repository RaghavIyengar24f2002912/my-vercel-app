Create an index file <code>/data/docs/index.json</code> that maps each filename (without the <code>/data/docs/</code> prefix) to its title (e.g. <code>{"README.md": "Home", "path/to/large-language-models.md": "Large Language Models", ...}</code> ).</strong></p>
<p>Here expected output JSON “key” is file name or file path without prefix /data/docs/ as prompt is bit confusing . when “path/to/large-language-models.md” is given in example is actually referring to file path or filename itself is “path/to/large-language-models.md”.</p><hr>

<p>Hi,<br/>
If you read these questions carefully then they are not similar, one is asking you to extract data from a webpage, meaning you have to do something related to the HTML code. And the other is simply sending a request to a given endpoint.</p><hr>
