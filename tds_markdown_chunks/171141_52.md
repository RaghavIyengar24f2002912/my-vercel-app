This works if you pass the actual value of the airproxy token at the command line while pulling the docker image. Please do look into this as Iâ€™ve put a lot of effort into this.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/23f2001975">@23f2001975</a> we had to rely on docker telling us whether an image was arm or x86. So thats why we just did what docker software told us. If it classified an image as arm then we ran it on arm. If it did not then we ran it on x86. Thats why we need students to look through the logs and identify issues so that we can make sure you get the correct evaluation.</p>
<p>If students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating students as well.
