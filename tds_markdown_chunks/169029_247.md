Could you kindly review this project instead of the previous link I shared? While I did not make any changes to the code, you can access and review it directly on GitHub.‚Äù</p><hr>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a></p>
<p>The same issue has affected several of us. During the last Google Meet session, we explained the situation to <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a>.</p>
<p>It seems that when we edit our responses, the timestamp with other values updates not submitted as new response. However, the position of the response in the form remains unchanged. For instance, we submitted our response at 11:30 PM on March 31st, and someone else submitted theirs at 11:45 PM. Even after editing our response the next day, our entry still appears above theirs.<br/>
We just wanted to clarify: Will responses edited or submitted on April 1st still be considered, given that the form remains open?
