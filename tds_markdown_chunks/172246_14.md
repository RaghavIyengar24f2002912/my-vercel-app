<p>The sudden introduction of bonus marks for GA7 in Tools in Data Science has left many students confused, as there was no prior intimation regarding this change. We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated “best 4 out of 7” policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment. Fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted; it is a fundamental right for every student.
