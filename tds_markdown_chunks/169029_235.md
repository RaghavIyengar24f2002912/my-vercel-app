<p>The way we test your api is <strong>not through a front end.</strong></p>
<p>We send a request to the endpoint directly. We have demoed it in live sessions.</p>
<p>We have even posted on discourse snippets of what this looks like.</p>
<p>As long as your endpoint responds to a request that we send, it will be fine.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p><hr>

<p>Just a brother trying to help students gain valuable skills.<br/>
Nothing more brother.</p>
<p>The success of studentsâ€™ future, is the best reward.</p>
<p>Sometimes it takes a bit longer because some lessons are harder than others. And we all make mistakes.
