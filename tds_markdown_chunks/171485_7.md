It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.</p>
<p>I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.</p>

<p>Sir,<br/>
Thankyou for your prompt reply to my query.<br/>
I wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself).<br/>
I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th.<br/>
I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it.<br/>
Thankyou!</p><hr>

<p>One thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb.
