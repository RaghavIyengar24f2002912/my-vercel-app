So you can breathe a sigh of relief. </p>
<p><em>However</em> with regards to your long postâ€¦</p>
<p>Let me tell you a true story. I personally know a <em>very</em> experienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him.</p>
<p>What you have done is what is called in industry as <strong>gold plating</strong>. Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec.</p>
<p>In fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why?</p>
<ol>
<li>Because it does not deliver what was required,</li>
<li>Wastes valuable time and resources</li>
<li>Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!)</li>
<li>Complicates testing</li>
<li>Leads to scope creep</li>
</ol>
<p>His advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate.</p>
<p>I hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out.</p>
<p>For personal hobbies this does not apply.
