With many ambiguities unresolved it’s hard to solve this and study for Quiz 2 (and do offline college work even though that’s not your problem).<br/>
Thanks</p><hr>

<p>Let’s wait for their response.<br/>
I submitted nearby option for Q3 and Q4</p><hr>

<h4>21f2000709 (#14)</h4>
<p>Yes, there are no specifics in Q1 to Q4 and are quite ambiguous.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>forecast the 2027 resale value of the Hero - HF Deluxe in Gujarat, using historical data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but is this talking about the average resale value as no input features are specified?</p><hr>

Dear TDS Team,</p>
<p>There are multiple issues in Graded Assignment 6 that require urgent attention:</p>
<ol>
<li>Questions 1 and 2, along with their options, are ambiguous.</li>
<li>In Questions 3 and 4, I am unable to obtain an exact answer that matches any of the given options, despite trying multiple approaches, including the Excel regression method and other models in a Google Colab file.</li>
<li>The data for Question 10 is missing.
