<p>Thank you for your response <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> and for addressing our concerns. We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience.</p>
<p>The reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next.</p>
<p>We will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results.
