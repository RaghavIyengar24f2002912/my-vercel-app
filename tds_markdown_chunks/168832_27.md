<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> sir,  I got disconnected at around 1:35 due to a network glitch and had to restart my uv server as well collab which wasted around 5 min and my score was around 7 and further I ran multiple scripts which I had already saved as code snippets as part of GA for question 4 on vs code and Collab and  finally got the answer but I exceeded the time limit since the submission I made was at 1:47:28 which was 9…so I request to please consider that<br/>
Overall the ROE was a great experience and I wholly enjoyed the process</p>
<p>Thank you for giving us this amazing opportunity<br/>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/21f3002158">@21f3002158</a></p>
<p>I looked for your result in backend, seems like you didn’t click to submit button throughout the exam.</p>
<p>Since roe exam portal was similar to GA’s where you need to save answers using save button, after saving only your answers get evaluated and you get answers.</p>
<p>There is no way other than pressing save button, we can’t do any help with this.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p><hr>

<h4>Jivraj (#71)</h4>
<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/23f2000778">@23f2000778</a></p>
<p>No need to worry about that, I have checked in backend your score is 10 of 10.</p>
<p>kind regards</p><hr>

<p>Charging wasnt an issue for me, my entire vsc just froze and the screen went blank during the last 5 mins.
