Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.</p>

<p>for the tunneling, i am currently unable to do it has the ports are mismatched, I’m still working on the issue, but using codespaces and public ports i’ve achieved similar results and the question is marked right. Is this wrong/unethical.
