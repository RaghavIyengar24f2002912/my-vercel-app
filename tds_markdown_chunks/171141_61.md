Is there no way to fix this now ? I can change the docker file and overwrite the docker image if you allow me to do so.</p><hr>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> good afternoon sir,<br/>
I completed my project 1 and submitted it as instructed. But the result show that evaluate file missing. I did everything right but don’t know how this as the result come. I also had evaluation file in my project too. Please go through things again as this is very unfair for those who took 2 weeks to do this project. My roll no. is 22f3001664. I hope I will get marks, of not full then should be 10/20.<br/>
Thank you sir</p><hr>

<p>Yeah, it’s there on your local machine, but you didn’t copy it to docker container.<br/>
Below is content of your docker file which doesn’t copy tasksA.py file it only copies app.py.
