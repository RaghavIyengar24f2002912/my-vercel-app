The scores will only be visible in the dashboard. Just ignore anything inside the seek portal. 
As stated in multiple places in discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission. 
Kind regards

<p>Only 1st Graded assignment scores are visible on dashboard. I have submitted 2nd and 3rd GA before the deadline but still it showing “not submitted” on the seek portal…</p><hr>

<h4>21f3000697 (#24)</h4>
<p>I recently got mail and checked my marks for GA2 and noticed that the final score is showing as <strong>4.25</strong>, but while attempting the assignment earlier, I had scored <strong>7.25</strong> shown after submission.</p>
<p>Could you please help me understand how the marks were reduced?
