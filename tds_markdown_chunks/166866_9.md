<p>We truly appreciate the efforts being put by the TDS team, but not to be rude here -</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why is Project 1 deadline is on Saturday and not on Sunday, as many of us are doing the course <strong>not as a full-time</strong> student. (Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated.</p>

<p>Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials.
