Do I have to attempt all questions again?<br/>
Why the assignment and submissions are two separate pages/links?<br/>
If [seek] (<a class="inline-onebox" href="https://seek.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/courses/ns_25t1_se2002">Nptel Seekh</a>) can access [TDS exam] (<a class="inline-onebox" href="https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Technical Assessment</a>) then why we need to submit from seek?</p><hr>

<p>Ok, thanks. I turned off many security features including anti-virus systemâ€™s security and windows security options etc. Then it allowed me to download uv on the system.
