These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer’s toolkit. Please make sure to use them.</p>
<p>To install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type <code>code -s</code>, then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below.</p>
